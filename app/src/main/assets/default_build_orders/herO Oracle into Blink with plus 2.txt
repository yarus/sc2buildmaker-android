You open with a forge expand, do a normal stargate oracle opening and instead of transitioning into robo you just get a twilight council after your 4gates and 3rd base. You then go up to 10 gates in total (4 starting, 2 at 3rd, 4 at 10:00) and a robo to round out your composition. The oracle should keep him back for a bit in the early game as well as give you enough information to know exactly what kind of follow up he is going for. The 4gates before 3rd and 6 sentries off of them will give you a nice defense vs early roach and or ling play to try and cancel your 3rd. Sometimes you\u0027ll have to give it up, however with the proper response (shown in one of the linked VODs) you can still end up winning.\n\nThe cool thing about this build is how versatile it is. Like I said, it has early pressure (which most fast +2 blink builds don\u0027t) while still being able to defend at home with sentries. It also deals with any sort of follow up very well with little deviation. If they\u0027re massing roaches (but a little bit later) you can just add in some immortals with your main blink/sentry force. If they go hydras you can go into colossi while abusing forcefields to take their army in chunks if they attack earlier. If they go mutas then you simply spam the fuck out of your warp gates with non stop stalkersand thrust them down his throat. You might need some cannons at home to defend if they go for a base trade but you should be able to just break them if you attack quickly enough.\n\nSince the swarm host nerf you hardly even see them anymore. They aren\u0027t hard to deal with at all. You can respond in the same way said below, but it\u0027s not nearly as difficult as described.\n\nThem going swarm hosts is when it gets a little trickier. You\u0027ll need to buy as much time as possible with your blink/sentry force while you tech up to double robo colossi. This includes sectioning off their 4th base to try and get a snipe on it, bouncing around creep and keeping it as far back as possible, also getting a warp prism while the robo bay is making to do zealot warp ins while attacking at an exterior base. It\u0027 requires some decent multitasking as well as a good understanding on how to play the mass harass style vs swarm hosts.\n\nOtherwise if they just kind of sit back and macro in a non swarm host way, then you just do some harass with the blink/sentry squad and warp prisms while going up to colossi anyway. If they go vipers then be sure to get a fast twilight for feedback. Other than that the build allows you to kind of do as you wish as it sets you up for a very solid and stable macro game.","Name":"herO Oracle into Blink with plus 2","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438694044534,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

However, because this build was created by SaSe, you are also low on minerals for quite some time and thus cannot afford losing mining time by scouting with a Probe.  Therefore, in the early game merely scout in your base for a proxy Gateway with the Probe who builds the 2nd Pylon; the rest of your scouting will come from your 3 Stalkers. Being active with these 3 Stalkers around your natural, third, and watchtower will prevent your opponent from sneaking proxy Pylons past you and hitting you with a very early Gateway attack. Thus, you will be able to see an incoming push coming before it’s too late, and can delay/cancel your fast expand in favor of more units if you need to.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build transitions very smoothly into Chargelot/Archon builds or Blink Stalker builds. To make either transition, first resume chronoboosting out probes from both Nexi and then start your research of choice (Charge or Blink). Adding on 2 more Gateways, and applying midgame pressure with lots of Gateways and 1 or 2 Archons is a great way to force units out of your opponent, scout what midgame tech he’s going, and possibly end the game if your DTs did too much damage.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is great because it gets a reasonably timed expansion, gives you DTs early for map control and potential game-ending damage, and lets you transition into an aggressive midgame with either Chargelots or Blink Stalkers at the core of your army composition.\r\nHowever, this build is very weak vs Oracle openers, for they give both detection and a great way to harass your naked mineral line. Also, against early attacks that hit before your Dark Shrine finishes, if you miss the proxy Pylon because you are not active enough with your first three stalkers, you can straight up lose the game. Your Planetary Nexus is good, but it is not quite good enough to fight off an actual army if you do not yet have one yourself.","Name":"SaSe DT Rush","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427979815716,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

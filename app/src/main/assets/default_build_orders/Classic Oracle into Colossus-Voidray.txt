Just make sure you keep the robo timing the same.\n\nThis build really relies on you being able to scout with the oracle and reacting to what the zerg is doing. It\u0027s a very reactive and versatile opening which why I said it doesn\u0027t really die to anything as long as you execute it properly. Even if the stargate gets scouted/the oracle can\u0027t get too much done don\u0027t worry. You at least want to get scouting information with it as that is the most important. The drone or queen kills are only an added bonus if they aren\u0027t prepared.\n\nIf you see any sort of ling pressure to contest your 3rd then you should bring the oracle back to help defend. It\u0027s best to move the oracle down the common path of attack when it spawns to see if this kind of pressure is coming.\n\nAny roach aggression can be stopped by earlier void ray production and even a few immortals before colossi if it\u0027s really early roach aggression.\n\nDefending hydra/ling attacks is all about good sim city and forcefields and being sure your colossus doesn\u0027t get supply blocked or delayed at all. Your colossus being late is probably the worst thing you can do with this build as that\u0027s what really keeps you alive vs a lot of zerg pressure.\n\nAnd of course if you see spire play then you have 3 stargates to make mass phoenix.\n\nOnce your 3rd is up and you get a decent void ray count up you can start teching to twilight council if you didn\u0027t have to already because you scouted a fast hive from zerg. From there you just play a standard PvZ mid/late game.","Name":"Classic Oracle into Colossus-Voidray","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438854132738,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

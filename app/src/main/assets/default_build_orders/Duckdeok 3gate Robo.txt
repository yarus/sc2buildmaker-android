This pressure build produces somewhat stable macro games if you react appropriately to your scouting information.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nFor all early game scouting, please refer to the Scouting section of the 3 Stalker Rush build.\r\n\r\nAfter your initial units have scouted around your side of the map, the majority of your scouting will come from your 3gate pressure at your opponent’s base.\r\n\r\n- If your opponent is fast expanding, then attempt to cancel the Nexus before it finishes. Warp in more units at your proxy Pylon for extra pressure.\r\n- If your opponent has just as many (or almost as many) Gateway units as you, immediately fall back and begin Immortal production. Against either Gateway attacks or Blink All-ins, you need a high Immortal count in order to defend.\r\n- If your opponent does not have as many Gateway units as you, then push up the ramp and attempt to kill his army. Do NOT over-commit once your opponent has activated Photon Overcharge. If you cannot push up his ramp, then warp-in a Sentry or two at his natural and set up a contain while you expand back at home. If during the contain a Stargate unit flies into your base, be sure to activate your Photon Overcharge in order to keep your Probes alive.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nOnce you have set up or a contain or you are forced to retreat back home, be sure to setup your natural expansion. Going into the macro game, however, the actual unit composition of your army very often depends completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with.  If your opponent stays on one base for too long, then throw down more Gateways, constantly make units, and prepare to defend your natural with Stalkers, Immortals, and your Planetary Nexus. In Robotics vs Stargate macro games, quickly switch into Blink or double Stargate play of your own so as to not lose against any Void Ray based armies. In Robotics vs Robotics macro games, Immortal count and/or Colossus count are the most important things. Keep tabs on your opponent’s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Robotics vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent’s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by producing Immortals+Gateway units or Colossus for defense.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Split your initial chronoboost on Probes and Warpgate Research in the early game so that you are not economically behind but still have a quick Warpgate attack.\r\n- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial 3 Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap’s 3gate All-in).\r\n- Against fast tech plays, your initial 3gate pressure should give you information on both the type and timing of your opponent’s attack. Be sure not to over-commit your Stalkers here, however, for Blink or Immortal all-ins will be able to hold your attack and counter-attack with a lot of force if you are careless with your initial units.\r\n- Against Blink play (or your opponent has a lot of Stalkers when you pressure), be sure to pull back immediately and start Immortal production.\r\n- Against Stargate play, use your Photon Overcharge to push back any Oracles or Phoenix if your Stalker army is out of position.\r\n- Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is a very versatile, safe build that takes advantage of early Gateway units to apply pressure as well as defend every sort of all-in that can hit you. It also gets detection and Immortals for defense against ground-based all-ins, so very often you have a more stable opening than most other PvP builds.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build forces you to be active on the map with your initial units. If you over commit your army unnecessarily or do not interpret your scouting information correctly, late all-ins can be very hard to stop.","Name":"Duckdeok 3gate Robo","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972490849,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

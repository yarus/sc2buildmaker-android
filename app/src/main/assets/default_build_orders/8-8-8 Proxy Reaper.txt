It then follows up with another Barracks so that you can make enough Reapers to overwhelm your opponent and outright win the game before it has even begun.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nYou will be doing this build no matter what, so there is no SCV scouting.  The rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers seeing what your opponent has. However, an interesting SCV timing to note: you will reach a very nice proxy location with your SCV on most 2 person maps if you send it out exactly as you get 50 minerals for the first time at 8 supply.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThere is no defined transition from this build; it is basically all-in after all.  However, if your opponent goes for very quick roaches then you might want to add-on Tech labs and get Marauders. Besides that, you should have enough Reapers to evenly trade with anything your opponent can make, as long as you can stutter step appropriately.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Do NOT lose any of your first 3 Reapers. They are the most important part of this build – applying the early pressure, forcing Drones to be pulled, and most importantly stopping Queens/Roaches from being made. If you lose them, you will most likely lose the game.\r\n- Do not stop for Hatcheries or buildings of any kind. Go straight for the Drones and force some to be pulled off the worker line. If your opponent has their full economy up they will simply outproduce you.\r\n- The only micro you have to do is stutter step against Zerglings/Drones, and pull back the weakest Reaper against Queens.\r\n- 4 Reapers will kill a Queen without you losing a single one of them as long as you pull the targeted Reaper back in time.\r\n- In order to hit the exact build order supplies above, you will have to cut some SCVs for several seconds. I highly recommend watching the tutorial replays (and using the Take Command button with a friend to see how you match up to it) until you get a hang of the build.","Name":"8-8-8 Proxy Reaper","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972476158,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

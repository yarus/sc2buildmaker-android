Once you determine your position in the game, you can easily expand and start teching up to immortal/archon.\n\nSo how exactly do you deal with the different openings?\n\nStargate:\n\nThis is a fairly simple one. Most of the time you won\u0027t be able to see that they\u0027re going stargate (unless it\u0027s a very quick directly after cyber build) in which case you will be playing defensively with your units anyway. Whether it\u0027s phoenix or oracle you will have 3 stalkers and a MSCore to deal with whatever comes at you with an additional 3 stalkers coming out of WG once that finishes, with blink soon following. This allows for a very easy stargate defense in which case you can then expand and put on light pressure with your blink/obs while defending at home with the MSCore.\n\nIf you want you can cancel the robo to go for a blink all in after seeing this, however some people (like Zest in the Shoutcraft tournament) will go for stargate and then DT to follow it up if they see you do blink/robo expecting you to cancel it. However this is usually because of pros at the highest level trying to get every ounce of their money for something beneficial, so it was mostly a smart gamble by Zest.\n\nBlink:\n\nWith blink you\u0027re going to have to identify it a little early. If you see a large stalker opening then blink should be in the back of your mind. In this case you can easily get an immortal out with time bought by overcharge so you can have blink + immo to his pure blink. If he commits heavily then you can usually just counter push for the win, or you can simply expand and be ahead since you have the tech advantage.\n\nDT:\n\nThis is quite simple as well. Robo finishes, you get an obs out, you kill DTs, you expand and continue as normal.\n\nRobo expand:\n\nIn this situation your nexus will be slightly farther behind than his, however you will have the ability to poke and prod at him with blink so the slightly later nexus is not the biggest of deals. You will have added mobility and you will also know that they are being super passive so you can chrono probes nonstop to get back on the same economic footing. The best thing you can do with your stalkers is to pick off sentries that you see in the front. This denies him scouting (no hallucination) and requires him to waste gas he doesn\u0027t want to replenish them if he really wants to.\n\nAfter you defend whatever build your opponent is going for and you have your natural set up, you want to simply transition into immortal/archon.","Name":"Creator Blink-obs expand","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438611575240,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

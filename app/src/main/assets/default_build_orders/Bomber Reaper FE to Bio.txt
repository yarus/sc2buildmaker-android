Then it follows up with a Bio army with just as much strength as a gasless 1rax FE can provide.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nThis build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponent’s first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.\r\n\r\nIf your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Also, if you do not know whether your opponent has a Stargate or not, it is a safe plan to build one Missile Turret per mineral line to defend any Oracle shenanigans.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and Medivacs. After this build, get a 3rd Command Center, 3 more Barracks (for a total of 8), and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.\r\n\r\nNote: It is completely viable to replace the 4th and 5th Barracks in this build with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost, most Terrans (including Startale Bomber) have been getting lots of Barracks early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having those extra reinforcements.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- The gas timing of this build is quite important – be sure to mine exactly 100 Gas so that you have enough for the Reaper and Reactor and no more.  Getting your natural Command Center up before the 2nd Supply Depot is a strength of this build.\r\n- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.\r\n- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add a 2nd Bunker at the front, and consider getting a Missile Turret in each mineral line.\r\n- Oracles, even with an expansion, massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you have to instantly get out one Missile Turret per mineral line.\r\n- The gas timings of this build are somewhat more delayed than what you might be used to if you usually play with a gasless 1rax FE.  Therefore, be sure to cut all Marauder production until after your Starport has completed.\r\n- When you move out with your Medivacs, be sure to boost in and out of where your opponent is expecting.  Forcing out the Mothership Core’s energy can be the difference between an quick win and a potential loss.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is good because it gives you the economy and infrastructure on par with a Wings of Liberty style 1rax FE. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Getting such a fast Reactor gives you enough marines to defend early game Stalker + Mothership Core harass.  Finally, this build takes no detours and goes directly into Bio+Medivac play, so your Stim+Medivac aggression happens much sooner than if you go for an early Widow Mine Drop.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes, especially if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting/turret timing is not perfect.","Name":"Bomber Reaper FE to Bio","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972344941,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

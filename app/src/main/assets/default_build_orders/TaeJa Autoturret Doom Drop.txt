Utilizing a gas first opening to stay safe against an opponent’s gas first aggression, this build gets a fast two Medivacs to violently drop 8 Marines, 2 Siege Tanks, and 3 Auto Turrets in a critical position of the enemy’s base.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nTaeja chooses only to scout with his Hellion, preserving all his SCVs for maximum income. At times, he cannot afford continuous Marine or SCV production in the demonstration replay; had he SCV scouted he would be even more pushed for minerals.\r\n\r\nSCV scouting is definitely an option if you do not feel safe enough with the delayed hellion scout, but it should be relegated to a 4:30 scout at the very earliest so as to not delay your Starport in any way.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build can transition into both Bio or Mech. Because you have made no major investments down either tech path, and you have exactly one of each necessary production structure, you can literally go into whatever style you want.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\nAgainst a live resisting opponent, execution of this build may run into some problems. They could be opening banshees; forcing Turrets to be made just before you move out. They could be doing the exact same build, resulting in a base trade. They could be doing earlier aggression that pins you in your base for longer than you’d like, such as an elevator attack or a doom drop.\r\n\r\nThere are reactions to each of these plays, and there are far too many to list here. Regardless of what happens though, sometimes it is important to identify that you are more ahead simply by staying home and defending, and not to blindly commit to the attack every single game. This will come by experience and repeatedly executing the build.\r\n\r\nThree main consistencies must be maintained;\r\n\r\n1) You MUST continue unit production behind this attack; you cannot start a big transition (adding on Barracks/Factories while freezing production by constructing addons) else you will be extremely vulnerable to a counter attack. The only exception is when you know with certainty that your opponent will not be performing some sort of counterattack (for example, he has gone 3 Barracks into delayed Factory, or he has gone for a elevator and you’ve already killed the medivacs beforehand).\r\n\r\n2) Once your autoturrets are dropped, it’s almost always a good idea to fly the Raven home; it will prove useful in the mid game.\r\n\r\n3) If they made Banshees, you have to make turrets before moving out, else risk losing the game. Delay this to the last possible moment, as you are already pressed for cash.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThe lethality of this build cannot be understated; you can simply win most games with this drop, especially against players who have gone for more macro oriented builds, such as a Reaper FE or a 15 gas style.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if your opponent identifies your build quickly enough and prepositions his units properly, or employs defensive AOE such as Tanks or Widow Mines, your drop may end up doing little to no damage, and you can easily die to a counter push or drop.","Name":"Taeja Autoturret Doom Drop","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972382652,"VsRace":"Terran"}

Imagine a baneling bust without having to sacrifice speedlings, or to have to waste all your gas on just the wall. Ravagers takes over for the role of banelings, and are usable after the wall has been taken down; to break down more walls, to shoot down air units, or being a meat shield plus ranged dps in the already powerful speedling rush.\n\nUsing the ravagers is the keystone to this strategy, so keep them alive. \n\nKeep your eyes open for any cheesier play than this (2 gate zealot rush, cannon rush, proxy play). \n\nPoint of the build is to rush 4 roaches, zergling speed, and enough gas to morph in 4 ravagers, and then to overwhelm them with shear numbers. This build works well because speed finishes as you start rallying zerglings across the map, and they should arrive just seconds before your roaches do at their base. Also, you should have enough gas as you arrive at their base to morph in all 4 ravagers. oOnce you start making zerglings, do not stop making zerglings, not even for another queen, until you do significant damage. You will be too far behind, unless you get into their base and wreck havoc, to switch into macro mode. \n\nStopping mining gas once you have enough for all the ravagers \n\nBuild Tips: \n\n- Use first two overlords to help see high ground with ravagers. \n\n- after first four roaches are made, stop mining gas as soon as you hit 300. This is the cost of 4 ravagers, and you won\u0027t need any more gas once you upgrade these units. \n\n- this build is viable vs Terran or Protoss but probably not zerg.\n\n","Name":"One Base Ravager, Speedling All In","Race":"Zerg","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1449507750993,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

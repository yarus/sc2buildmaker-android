If you are performing this build vs a gasless Terran, you can be much more aggressive with your initial 3 units and oracle. Versus a gassing Terran, you must be wary of Widow Mines, so be sure not to clump up your units when pushing up ramps or going into your opponent’s mineral line with your Oracles.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build is an all-in, so note that there is no clear transition out of it.  Continue making oracles (up to 3 or 4) and warping in Stalkers so that you can break the front. Note that if your opponent does eventually hold and you end up losing your entire army, then you are most likely behind both economically and in tech. Only expand and continue producing Probes once/if you break the front and you are just making sure that you have enough economy to follow up with a win.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build hits very early with a proxied Oracle, taking advantage of the weakness of early game Marines without upgrades. This build is so strong because it gives you enough units to pressure both your opponent’s front and their mineral line simultaneously. It also then gives you the infrastructure needed to warp-in enough Gateway units to eventually bust down your opponent’s front.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build is a very micro intensive build – you must be target firing with your Oracle in the main, while not losing any of the units in the front, usually for at least 3 minutes. It is also weak vs Widow Mines if you have poor control. Lastly, note that this build is in fact an all-in, so doing some damage but losing your entire army does put you behind by quite a bit.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Chronoboost your initial Stalker so that you deny scouting from your opponent as soon as possible.\r\n- Do not get your initial Probe trapped in your opponent’s base or killed, for that will force you to send another Probe to build the proxy Pylon and lose more mining time.\r\n- You have to target fire individual SCVs for the Pulsar Beam to be most effective.\r\n- One Oracle can take down 4 Marines if it has enough energy for Pulsar Beam the entire time.\r\n- You can use the Oracle’s Envision spell for mobile detection in case your opponent has opened Widow Mine or Banshee.\r\n- Be wary of Widow Mines both in the front or in the main mineral line and stay alert of the 40 second cooldown they have between shots.\r\n- Don’t forget to use the Mothership Core’s Time Warp ability to help vs SCVs/marines in the attack at the front.\r\n- Once/if you break the front, be sure to build an expansion and resume Probe production just in case your opponent does eventually hold.","Name":"3gate Proxy Oracle All-in","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972555732,"VsRace":"Terran"}

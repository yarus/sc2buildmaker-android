I discussed in an earlier post that Protoss likes to go for two base Colossus with a delayed third Nexus. Logically, it makes sense that Terran’s standard two base push is less effective against a delayed third Nexus. The two base Colossus allows Protoss to take a third safely with the Colossus. A good response to a defensive build is to use an economic build. Although I suggested in the earlier post that Protoss could punish an early third Command Centre, I think a slightly quicker third is doable. This build produces Siege Tanks to cover this potential weakness (see first vod below). In the second vod below, Maru had the same idea, but he made a Viking instead of a Widow Mine drop because the opponent went for a Stargate tech. Consistent with my earlier argument, Maru did not make Siege Tanks, as the Stargate tech suggests the opponent is not doing a two base Colossus build.","Name":"ReaperCC into MineDrop into 3rd CC","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1606199026638,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

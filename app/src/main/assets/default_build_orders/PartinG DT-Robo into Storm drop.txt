It\u0027s quite flexible to your standards so if you have a preference on how you like to open DT/robo then by all means do your own. I just modified the one that PartinG did in this particular game to have an earlier robo for safety (since he got his kinda late in this particular game) so that way you have an example.\n\nThe follow up is quite simple really. So long as you\u0027re playing vs passive players you can simple go up to templar archives for storm fairly quickly while being safe. There\u0027s not too much a 2 base protoss can do to punish. If you\u0027re scared they might do some kind of push you can just get archons faster and get some immortals earlier as well and you should be good. PartinG even gets 2 base all inned this game after his first storm drop and he can still hold after even trying to take a greedy 3rd.\n\nThe timings for the templar archives can vary based off of what happens in the early game. Not every game will be a passive DT/robo vs robo FE game so of course you\u0027ll have to adjust a little bit, but this build is more of a build concept than a solid build order since it incorporates mid/late game PvP which never is set in stone.Â ","Name":"PartinG DT-Robo into Storm drop","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438345303697,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

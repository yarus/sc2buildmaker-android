The majority of information about what Terran is doing however will come from what your opponent hits you with.  If you spot a Reaper coming into your base, then try and stop it from seeing your building Stargate with your Stalker and Mothership Core (do not worry too much if it is spotted however, for your Stargate is only initially being used for one Oracle). If you do not spot a Reaper, then send your Mothership Core and use its huge sight range to spot what buildings your opponent has inside of his base before returning home.\r\n\r\nThe majority of your midgame scouting will come from your Oracle. Use it to spot whether your opponent is opening with Bio, going for fast upgrades, fast triple Command Center, or strong 2 base timing. If you see an opening, then the Oracle can be used to harass your opponent’s SCVs, but the true purpose of the Oracle is constant scouting through the midgame. Your opponent’s 3rd base timing is especially useful as a good benchmark for when you should try and take your 3rd base.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThe build transitions into a Phoenix/Colossus midgame, with a standard Colossus/High Templar/Archon late game. As soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base, secure a third of your own, then start 2 Forges and several more Gateways. Keep producing Phoenix and Colossus until you have around 7 of each (7 is a LOT for a normal game, but the heavily delayed High Templar tech means that you have a stronger army in the midgame), supplementing your army with Zealots when you have extra minerals. Finally, when your +1/+1 is halfway done, be sure to start a Twilight Council for +2/+2, Zealot Charge, and Templar Archives in order to reach your lategame army.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- In the early game, you are attempting to get your economy up enough to support Phoenix/Colossus on 2 bases.  Be sure to chronoboost your Probes constantly until you need to divert chronoboost to your Robotics Facility/Stargate.\r\n- Against Reaper play, position your initial Stalker and Mothership Core defensively.  Try to deny it scouting your Stargate, but don’t worry if it is scouted–the Stargate is only initially used for one Oracle.\r\n- The main purpose of your initial Oracle is for scouting. While it is true that you can kill several SCVs if your opponent’s Marines are out of position, do NOT sacrifice your Oracle for a few extra kills. The constant threat of harass and ability to scout for the first 10 minutes of the game is a lot more important than an extra SCV kill or two.\r\n- Position your Phoenix defensively outside your main (to absolutely shut down any midgame drops) up until you are ready to take your third.  If/when your Oracle dies, use your flock of Phoenix to take map control and kill several SCVs with any extra APM you have.\r\n- Take your third base and start 2 Forges as soon as you spot your opponent taking his 3rd base.\r\n- Build more Colossus (up to 7) than you normally would (around 4). With the extra air support tanking and killing Vikings, your Colossus count must be quite large in order to take out your opponent’s Bio army.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build gets out an early Oracle for harass potential and constant scouting. It also gets a strong economy and uses a midgame Phoenix/Colossus unit composition to defend drops and bio pushes with ease. This midgame composition is quite robust in terms of defending your third as well as stopping constant Medivac harass.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build is short on Gateway units for the early stages of the game. Thus, any early drops are quite hard to stop unless you are able to scout them beforehand and prepare appropriately. Also, you do not start your Forges until you start your third base, so you will often be behind in upgrades against a macro-Terran.","Name":"Jim 1 gate FE to Phoenix-Colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972550147,"VsRace":"Terran"}

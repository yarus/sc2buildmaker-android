Like I said it\u0027s a bit challenging but if you want you can just incorporate the main ideas of the build into your own standard robo openings that you\u0027re familiar and comfortable with. The build starts with a fancy 2 gas opener with probes being rallied in 1 at a time after you have full mineral saturation. If anyone remembers a long time ago the SaSe aggressive 3 gate opening that Day9 did a daily on, it\u0027s very similar to how the gasses were filled in that build. Whether or not it\u0027s better to do it this way or to just do a normal 2 in each or 1 with 3, I don\u0027t really know. I\u0027m sure you can get to the same out come with whatever gas opener you\u0027re familiar with but if you wanna be try hard and feel cool then go ahead and try this method. I personally found it quite smooth when I tried it.\n\nNow the build starts with a normal robo timing just like any other standard opening. The natural gasses are a bit earlier however since the build is quite gas intensive (you\u0027ll also need the extra gas for 2 sentries while teching up heavily to be able to defend). That\u0027s another thing you can simplify if you\u0027d like if you don\u0027t think you\u0027ll remember to fill the gas up later on. Once the robo bay is done you\u0027ll get your first colossus but instead of getting range you get warp prism speed to aid in your colossus drop harassment. Since we aren\u0027t committing fully to colossus we won\u0027t need range this early and instead we put that gas towards a fast twilight council to go into storm for a 2nd form of harassment in the storm drop.\n\nOnce your harassment with the colossus starts you should be getting a few extra gateways to prepare for any medivac timing the terran may want to use. Your extra resources should also be put into some immortals while you wait for your tech to get up. You should also be sure to warp in 2 HT\u0027s when you start storm so by the time storm is done you can immediately go and use them for the storm drop. So once storm is done, bring the colossus home and switch it for the HT\u0027s and go for round 2 of your wonderful harassment. You can also warp in archons at home to help defend and bolster your army. You\u0027ll have quite the beefy army with immortals and archons and storm with 1 colossus. If you remember the old rangeless colossus into storm builds, this is very similar to that except that you\u0027re doing harassment with the first colossus.\n\nFrom the storm drop you simply add on more gates as you feel necessary and get the upgrades and charge going and transition into a normal macro game. You get your 3rd when you feel safe and you can transition into 2 robo colossi whenever you feel comfortable to throw the terran off even more.\n\nSimplifications/Alternative Follow ups\n\nIf you feel the colossus drop into storm drop is a little too much for you (opening storm these days isn\u0027t always the easiest thing in the world) then you can very easily just continue down the colossus tech route. The extra resources you will bank by not going twilight tech can be used for earlier gateways or earlier double forge. Or you can go into twilight still and go for blink for an easier drop defense option.\n\nSomething else you can do is do a big 7gate colossus all in like Classic did vs Polt on Nimbus at Blizzcon.\n\nIf you still want to go down the storm route but feel like you\u0027re kind of skimping on defense by loading your first to HT\u0027s to do a drop, then you can also easily just play more passive after the colossus drop. You can play it like the old rangeless colossus into storm builds like I mentioned and wait for the terran to sac a little bit into your unexpected storm transition. At that point you should feel more safe to incorporate some storm drops into your play.\n\nAgain, while this may not be the most solid or perfect build, it is a way to freshen up your games and force you to try some fun early game harassment that normally you aren\u0027t able to do. So even if you can\u0027t follow the build perfectly, at least try out some of the ideas in it and incorporate them into your own builds.","Name":"HerO Speedprism colossus drop into storm drop","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439297383708,"VsRace":"Terran"}

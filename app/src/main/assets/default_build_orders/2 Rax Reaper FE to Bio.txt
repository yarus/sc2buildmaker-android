It is a great way to get complete map control with 4 Reapers, apply heavy pressure to an expanding opponent, and transition into standard Bio play.  This 2rax Reaper build also can instantly win against some Gas First or CC First builds.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nThis build is a reasonably safe build against most things Terran can open with as long as you are smart with your initial four Reapers. Thus, SCV scouting early on is not required or even suggested. Use your Reapers to take map control and pick off Marines/scout the front. However, there may come a time when your opponent has a Bunker up and you can no longer poke the front. Then, while prioritizing keeping your Reapers alive over all else, jump into his base and pick off SCVs/continue to scout.\r\n\r\nIf you scout your opponent opening Banshee, then cease Reaper production–instead, favor making Marines and getting an earlier Engineering Bay. If you scout a Widow Mine Drop, then be wary of your opponent’s Medivac, and hole up in your main base until you have enough units to stabilize. If you scout a Marine/Tank/Banshee all-in, then keep your 2nd Command Center in your main base and play defensive. If you scout a 1rax FE, then scout for the Bio or Mech follow-up, and apply pressure whenever possible.\r\n\r\nNote: If you scout your opponent going Mech, then add a 2nd Tech lab instead of Reactor on your initial Barracks and build some marauders too.  You can still follow the same basic build order, but you will have a little less gas than normal, so you might need to get early gas geysers than what is written up above.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build commits too much into Infantry upgrades for you to transition into Mech. However, it transitions quite smoothly into Marine/Tank or pure Bio (vs Mech).\r\n\r\nFor a Marine/Tank transition, start a Tech lab on your Factory for Siege Tank production, take your third base, start your 4th-6th gas geysers, and start another Engineering Bay+Armory for more upgrades. With your midgame push, confirm what unit composition your opponent is going, and play aggressively/passively accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor a pure Bio transition (if your opponent is playing Mech), start another Engineering Bay and Armory to continue your upgrades as you take your 3rd Command Center and keep your opponent pinned back. Threaten boosted Medivac drops whenever possible, but do not over commit your army if your opponent has an adequate defense.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is a safe build that also opens aggressively. With this build, you can pick off Marines and SCV, while simultaneously getting a full scout of your opponent’s base and stressing their multitasking. This build also has a heavy Marine follow up, and can deal with Banshees or 1/1/1 all-ins rather well due to the Reactor/Tech lab first. This transitions into normal Bio play but gives you the advantage due to early harass and map control.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build performs poorly against early Hellion openings. If you scout Reactored Hellions, cease Reaper production instantly and transition into faster Marine/Marauder production. Also, if your opponent holds the Reapers cost-effectively with a 1rax FE or CC First (either due to you mis-microing, or them having a solid defense), then you will be behind going into the midgame economically.","Name":"2 Rax Reaper FE to Bio","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428414996384,"VsRace":"Terran"}

# sc2buildmaker
This is home for SC2BuildMaker android tool source code.
IDE - Android Studio

Ideas for future improvements
1. Build Orders centric social network - we could allow users to comment and rate each build order from the app so each build order could be transformed into forum-like thread where every user could left his comment. That would improve communication between users. sc2bm.com web site api could be used to host entrypoints for such service.
2 Update android app icon to support latest google standards.
3. Migrate to Xamarin using sc2buildmaker-win repository to allow publishing the app into Apple store.

Ideas for future improvements
1. Allow to add build order items in the middle of the build. We can use selected item as a base for add/delete actions but we need to veirfy build order after that since adding or removing item in the middle of the build might invalidate it.
2. SC2 simulator - instead of calculating best time to add build order items we might start game timer and allow user to add build items like he would do in the game. This concept could be used to learn build orders - aka compare what user did with what he should be doing according to the build.
3. Build Orders centric social network - we could allow users to comment and rate each build order from the app so each build order could be transformed into forum-like thread where every user could left his comment. That would improve communication between users. sc2bm.com web site api could be used to host entrypoints for such service.
4. Update android app icon to support latest google standards.
5. Update Video Guide on google play.
6. Migrate to Xamarin using sc2buildmaker-win repository to allow publishing the app into Apple store.

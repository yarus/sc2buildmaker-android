Since the ramp is so small you can easily forcefield it off and be slightly greedier with your opening (so long as your reaction times are good) and the phoenix cater to the large amount of drop area.\n\nThe build opens with a standard oracle for some harassment and scouting. Very normal and cool. It goes into a fast 5 phoenix after the oracle to further harass (if you want to reveal them) and also shut down drops early on to keep you safe to tech up to templar. HerO does both. I\u0027ve seen him reveal them after 3 to start doing some harassment with the oracle (usually if they open delayed mines so you can pick up the mines and continue harassing) or he will keep them hidden like vs Polt (someone he knows loves his drops) so you can catch some medivacs for free.\n\nAfter that you go into charge and an archon or two to get your 3rd up. This is going to be the hard part to stay stabilized. This is when terran will try to really pressure you to keep you off 3 bases and away from storm. This is why HerO gets a decent gateway count before taking the 3rd as you will need as many units as possible to keep them away and your 3rd safe.\n\nOnce the 3rd is set and you have storm you should have a decent time keeping terran back as you try a storm drop or two while you tech up to colossi as well to abuse any lack of vikings. I prefer to add a 2nd robo as well when the colossi tech up starts so that way you can really hit with a hard transition of suddenly 2 and suddenly 4 colossi instead of just getting one and slowly go up. It\u0027s much easier for terran to transition himself when you only do 1 colossus at a time so if you do double robo you can open a timing window for yourself if the terran isn\u0027t scouting/reacting properly.\n\nAll in all, just try to have fun with this build. It\u0027s something we haven\u0027t seen in a while and something fresh so just do what you want with it.","Name":"HerO oracle-phoenix into HT","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439305542748,"VsRace":"Terran"}

It\u0027s been done before but recently it\u0027s become very popular in Korea. So the idea behind this is that you get the best of both worlds. You get a very fast nexus for early eco as well as a fast gateway for early tech. So it\u0027s basically like a gate FE combined with a nexus first. If you notice they\u0027re going for an early pool then you can just chrono zealots and do a kind of delayed gate FE and be fine, and if not then you just continue as normal being nice and greedy with your early nexus and tech.\n\nAfter the opening then it\u0027s a super safe build since you get early sentries and 2 gates to wall off. You shouldn\u0027t really lose to any thing once you get the wall up. You then transition into a few more sentries and gates while taking a 3rd and youpressure him with sentry stalker. This part of the build is very similar to the old PartinG fake 3 base 7 gate build, however you\u0027re still macroing behind it.\n\nThe goal with this attack is to just force units and make him think you\u0027re all inning (which you aren\u0027t) and if you catch him off guard you can definitely kill the 3rd. It\u0027s just to set up for the next attack that comes.\n\nTransition to mid game\n\nThe transition is quite simple and the \"in\" thing to do right now. You simply get +2 and blink and then attack. Basically every Korean protoss is doing this right now and it\u0027s winning games left and right. There\u0027s not really a good answer to this for zerg other than getting vipers which are easily dealt with by high templar. So with a critical mass of blink/sentry you can cut up roach/hydra indefinitely and you should be able to win whatever fight. It\u0027s also great for cutting up small spaces so you can snipe hatches better.\n\nWhatever damage you did with the first push should give you a timing to hit with the 2nd push. So long as you don\u0027t over commit and lose more than you should (recall when you think you\u0027re starting to lose too much) you should be in good shape. If they\u0027re super preparedthen you simply use the 2nd push as a poke and threaten to kill him while you\u0027re simply macroing up on 3 bases going into templar tech and harassing with the warp prism. And then from there you just kind of keep doing the same thing just with HT\u0027s next time and keep going until it works.","Name":"herO 5 gate sentry pressure into 7 gate blink","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438863595998,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

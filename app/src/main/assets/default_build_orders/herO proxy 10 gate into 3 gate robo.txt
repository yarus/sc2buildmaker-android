However, if your initial few units do literally nothing then you are indeed dead.\n\nIf he scouts early and sees your proxy, you should go with the first zealot otherwise he\u0027s going to have more than enough time to prepare for the 2nd one. If he doesn\u0027t scout and you can get 2 zealots out then wait for the 2nd one so that way it still hits with a surprise but has the ability to deal twice the damage. From there you should chrono out as many stalkers as you feel necessary. If you think you\u0027re pressure is being held easily then stop making them and focus on a transition back home. If you are dealing a lot of damage then continue chronoing them out.\n\nBack home herO goes for 2 more gates for even more aggression once warp gate is done (and ends up winning the game with it) as well as a robo for protection vs DTs and for a stable follow up if the 3gate follow up does not kill him.\n\nThe reason for robo over anything else is because:\n\nHe saw a twilight council so the threat of DTs is there. Also his twilight would be too late for blink vs blink so going for immortals is safer.Stargate always has the possibility of losing to DT and blink (especially since blink is so common now and a common follow up to a held proxy)DT is too easily expected after a failed proxy\n\nSo robo is the safest option. If you scout certain things like a stargate or robo then going for blink or oracle respectively will obviously be good in those situations. However in the context of this game, robo is the safest. It will always be the safest if you don\u0027t want to try ANY risks after your proxy but it may not always have the most potential.","Name":"herO proxy 10 gate into 3 gate robo","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438344042950,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

While this did get slightly nerfed with the new patch, so far it is still definitely possible to pull them off, however you just have to be a little bit careful.\n\nThe scout allows you to see exactly what tech you\u0027re going against since blink can be a little bit risky at times. Here\u0027s a general idea of what you can do vs some particular openings with this build:\n\nVs. Robo expands: So robo expands are tough builds to crack with blink openers. You really need to stretch them thin with blink and get a little fancy with warping in a sentry and force them into the main and forcefield them in to snipe the natural or visa versa etc. But you normally can\u0027t straight win vs robo expands an you\u0027ll just need to expand and probe behind it. For a little more in expanding out of blink openers in PvP check outÂ Day9\u0027s daily #674.\n\nVs. Stargate openers: So generally this is where this build shines the most. You should be able to get in their while their unit count is low and screw them up. There isn\u0027t too much to say here except to remember about the potential oracle swinging in the back and ruining your day, as well as to not be too overeager with void ray #yolo blinks as you can find yourself losing quite quickly. Just be patient and mass a good stalker count and hit when you know it\u0027s right.\n\nVs. DTs: This is where the MSCore scout comes into play the most. When going vs DT\u0027s you\u0027re going to need to drop a robo ASAP (before or after blink depending on how quickly they made the dark shrine) and you\u0027re going to have to macro out of it. It\u0027s very difficult to break a DT opener with blink as you have to wait for multiple observers to know you\u0027re safe. Just poke and prod a bit and see what damage you can do while expanding yourself.\n\nVs. Blink: This is all up to micro. You have to simple be VERY careful about analyzing your stalker count in comparison to his before engaging and to micro your god damn heart out. Blink vs blink doesn\u0027t happen too often, but when it does it\u0027s literally about who has more stalkers, so you need to be extra crisp when this happens. If you can find any small advantages like a few hits on a stalkers hull in the initial mid map skirmishes it will only help you.","Name":"PartinG 3 gate blink","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438609486383,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

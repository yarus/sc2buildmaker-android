It starts off with a very fast stargate for a lot of oracles to really delay any attack a terran can do. The cool thing is that he doesn\u0027t even care if the stargate gets scouted, because the initial oracle isn\u0027t what the surprise is about. That just tips him off and keeps him at home for a bit. The real surprise is the 4 more oracles that follow up after that.\n\nThe idea behind this is that you use 1 oracle at a time to harass and do normal oracle things in early game PvT, never revealing that you have more than 1 oracle. Then right as they move out to do their little mid game pressure you come in with 5 oracles and snipe all of their add ons so that way they can hardly produce anything. This is extremely smart since 5 oracles DPS down add ons extremely quickly and once they\u0027re dead the terran has to either come back to clean them up so they can re make their add ons (which takes a long time and takes away from production) or they still continue with their pressuring leaving 5 oracles in their base with even more limited production (only 1 marine at a time from each barracks and only 1 medivac or viking at a time out of the starport).\n\nAll the while you are doing this you are transitioning safely into colossus so you can easily hold the pressure that they may decide to do.\n\nIt\u0027s a very simple and clear thought process that leads up to a really cool and straight forward game plan.\n\nHowever what happens if stuff goes a little bit wrong?\n\nThe mass turreting player\n\nWe all know this person. The guy that sees one spec of a stargate play and they make a ring of turrets all around their base cough avilo cough. So how do we get anything done with our 5 oracles? You simply abuse the fact that they\u0027re playing extremely defensive and play greedy yourself. You won\u0027t be able to get a WHOLE lot done with the oracles, however having 5 oracles that early is still really good. You can easily still keep constant revelation on the terran army so you can see what they\u0027re doing at all times, as well as just picking off units in every small spot you see. Also 5 oracles will kill a turret without losing anything if it is not being repaired, so you can snipe turrets that don\u0027t have SCVs near them. However once repair gets going it\u0027s almost impossible to kill the turret.\n\nFrom here you can play super greedy because they\u0027re investing 100% into defense. You can do a style similar to how HerO played vs Polt at IEM Cologne where you go double forge into storm and charge with a 3rd base while constantly harassing with the oracles. You don\u0027t have to go colossus since the threat of a counter attack is not immediate, so you have more time to build up. The link to this game will be below in the VODs section.\n\nThe stim timing player\n\nA good amount of people aren\u0027t waiting for their first medivacs to push anymore. They\u0027re doing slightly earlier pushes with stim to catch greedy openings off guard. If this is the case you\u0027ll have to be able to pick up on this with a unit at the watch tower (or with your oracle) and just bring the oracles back home to help defend instead of go for the add ons. You should have 4 or 5 oracles by the time this hits and your gateways should be finishing up as well. In combination with overcharge and good control you should be able to clean it up without losing all of your oracles. You can then continue on with colossus and harassment with the oracles you have left.\n\nThe widow mine defense player\n\nThe hardest part about this is knowing that the widow mines are being used. However once you do know then once you have 4 oracles you\u0027ll be fine to continue harassment. 4 oracles attacking (1 with revelation as well of course) will 1 shot a widow mine. 3 oracles attacking will kill the widow mine half a second after the shot goes off, so you will trade an oracle for a widow mine. Less than that isn\u0027t worth it at all.\n\nIf you don\u0027t feel safe going against a gas first opener or other 1 base plays using this build, then simply scout what the terran is doing and go for a more safe play.","Name":"Top 5 oracle macro style","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439387821551,"VsRace":"Terran"}

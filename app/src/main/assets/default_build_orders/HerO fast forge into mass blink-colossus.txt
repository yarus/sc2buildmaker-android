During the beginning of HotS a lot of protoss were doing these robo into fast 5:45 forge timings (mostly with Twilight builds) to be as greedy as possible. Then more aggressive openers started to come out as they were figured out, but herO has been preferring this very passive and solid/unbreakable throwback style and it is working quite well.\n\nThe idea of the build is very simple. It\u0027s a passive build that keeps you alive vs basically anything the terran can throw at you while you get very quick upgrades and a rounded out blink/colossus transition. It\u0027s not the super fast blink like herO also likes to use, but instead the super fast upgrades. I think this style is slightly better just because getting blink that early isn\u0027t THE most beneficial thing as you can still deal with drops well without blink that early, so instead it\u0027s better off you get faster upgrades.\n\nYou will be focusing mostly on stalkers with this build instead of zealots like most other builds. The goal besides being super safe with this build is to max out VERY quickly. You go up to 5 colossus with this build with 2/2 upgrades being done at around 14 minutes and a LOT of stalkers underneath to snipe any vikings. Most terrans will do some sort of SCV pull timing after seeing such a heavy commitment to colossus. Luckily for us that plays right into our hands. Most terrans aren\u0027t expecting 2/2 to be done before their attack or for there to be 5 colossus out. A perfect example of this is herO vs Flash in the Shoutcraft invitational (link below). With the amount of stalkers you will be making the vikings will die extremely quickly if you focus fire properly and you\u0027ll be left with 3-5 colossus swiping away at all the bio which leads to a clean and easy victory.\n\nHowever what if they don\u0027t try to do a timing? What if they stay back passively going up to the death ball combo of ghost/viking? herO showed a very interesting switch up against Innovation by going for 5 stargate tempest when seeing his opponent was playing passively. He still gets storm since storm is obviously great, however he does a very fast transition into tempest when he sees ghost/viking come out. This allows him to force engagements properly vs ghost/viking in a very early stage that usually wouldn\u0027t be possible.\n\nWhat about the early game though? Gemini what if they do some scary 1 base gas first play of some sorts? No problem at all. The build already opens with the exact tools you need to stop any gas first opening. 3 stalkers + a robo and MSCore will be able to stop basically anything coming at you (or at least give you the right starting tools to hold it off). From there you can get 2 extra gateways before the forge if you want to play even safer (if they do more than just an early mine drop or something and commit to 1 base aggression) or just take your forge right after dealing with the drop as normal.\n\nLike I said the build is EXTREMELY solid and can\u0027t really be broken by anything except for some weird early stim timings that can get a little #dicey. Every protoss should have this build in their arsenal.","Name":"HerO fast forge into mass blink-colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439388813677,"VsRace":"Terran"}

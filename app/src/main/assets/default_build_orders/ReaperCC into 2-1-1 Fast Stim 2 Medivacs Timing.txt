This is enough to pressure your opponent, so get out there and use your units. It takes a lot of attention and focus to use your drops effectively, but it\u0027s good training to always be active with your units.\n\nFrom here, you can decide how you want to approach the mid-game. If you do lethal damage with your drop, you can go straight into 5 barracks production and finish the game. If you feel like you\u0027re ahead and want to get more ahead, get that third base and engineering bay for upgrades. If you see that you need splash damage, you can choose between tanks, mines or hellbats. You can even mix in vikings and liberators later on.","Name":"ReaperCC into 2-1-1 Fast Stim 2 Medivacs Timing","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"4.11.3","VisitedDate":1514560642180,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

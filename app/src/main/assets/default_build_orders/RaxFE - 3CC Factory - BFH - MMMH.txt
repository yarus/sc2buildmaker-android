This build uses guile to hide the BFH timing (most zergs won’t expect a hyper aggressive timing to follow a super greedy 3 CC build). It also is NOT all in; behind the BFH timing you will have 8 Rax, 2 Factories and 1 Starport as well as 3 saturated bases. You can do the Hellbat Bio style, or can go into a Dream-esque MMMM Thor composition. Your call!\n\nThis is the second greediest opening you can do in TvZ behind Bomber’s CC 1st - 3CC factory build. It will give you some marines (up to 4) with which to defend and push away overlords.\n\nBomber places his 3rd CC in a very obvious place, likely to trick the zerg into assuming utter greed rather than Greed -\u003e Hyper Aggression.\n\nThe early bunker and 4 Marines will defend against super fast busts involving low unit counts. You will have to SCV repair micro to hold them and likely add extra bunkers. By 7:30 you will have a decent number of hellions. You will lack the Banshee common in the Dream style (3 Reaper, Fast 3CC, Defensive Banshee, MMMM) but with repair micro and all those hellions you will be able to hold. You could also send a small force of hellions out on the map to harass while you defend and take the wind out of the bust.\n\nIf the zerg is doing a macro play they won’t have speed banes or mutas at 9:00 when the 13-16 hellions hit. Roaches will cause a bit of a problem, but, you can split your hellion forces and still get a lot of drone kills. In either case, getting drone kills is critical (15-20 minimum) in order to slow down the tech of zerg and delay Mutas and speed banes. Zerg will have to re-drone and also get ling bling to defend against the second hellion wave.\n\nOnce 12:30 hits, you simply begin a parade push with your Bio Hellbat force. Like most Bomber builds you will need to split your butt off, but hey, splitting is critical to playing Terran so you may as well practice it and aim to make it a reliable skill.","Name":"RaxFE - 3CC Factory - BFH - MMMH","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439733352704,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

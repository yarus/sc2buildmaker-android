You can just do some normal harassment with the first adepts and MSCore and still do the follow up the same and have it work out decently. If you would like you can still do the pylon stuff, but just know it will delay something of course.\n\nSo trying not to go into too much detail, it seems like the early game of PvP does use fast expansions as well now. So instead of going nexus first or 19 nexus, there\u0027s some builds like this one that use two early gates to do some pressure while getting a slightly later expansion. The whole point of these kinds of builds is just to try and slow down the opponent as much as possible and to distract them from whatever their plan was. The early adept pressure can hopefully get in to do some probe kills and set you up to either win the game with the DT follow up if they aren\u0027t prepared or to just continue that light pressure while teching and expanding. A cute trick I learned from mcanning with early adept trades to try and set up the early adept pressure is that you want to try and intercept his adept by leaving yours near your base so that he shades forward to you without realizing it. Most of the time they\u0027ll be on move command and you can get the first shot off, which allows you to win the trade and with two more coming out from your double gate you should be able to capitalize on that with some probe kills.\n\nI\u0027ve been seeing a lot of people open blink after expanding so DTs do have a nice place in punishing builds like that by making them at this kind of awkward timing. It also gives you some nice constant harass pressure throughout the mid game by having DT open so early. You need to think of it like old DT/robo openings from HotS. You shouldn\u0027t go into the build expecting the DTs to win you every game, but just to use them conservatively to give you a small edge with map control and some potential worker kills. If you do notice their build lacking detection however, then feel free to pick up your free win.\n\nAfter the DT harass, you can tech to the standard Protoss unit composition that is blink/disruptor while also getting a forge for upgrades and a 3rd base when you feel safe.\n\n\n\n","Name":"HerOs 2gate adept into DT","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"3.8.0","VisitedDate":1470914136788,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

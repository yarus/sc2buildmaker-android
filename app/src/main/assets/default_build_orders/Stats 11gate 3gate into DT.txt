The 11 gate gets out a fast chronoboosted stalker and if your opponent isn\u0027t paying attention (most of the time they aren\u0027t) you\u0027ll be able to kill their scouting probe with the stalker and keep them completely in the dark. With that first stalker you can then easily take watch towers and look around the map to find any other hidden probes they may send out, or even catch the MSCore across the map if they try to scout you that way. The 11gate stalker really gives you a lot of early game map control so please use that to its advantage.\n\nThe attack itself should go pretty normally. Use the first stalker to poke up a bit after you scout around the map. This will let you know if they expanded early or not. Don\u0027t fully commit until you have both stalkers though (especially against double gate openers) since it\u0027s pretty easy to get caught out with it. The fact that you\u0027re 3gating and that you\u0027re making stalkers will really trip your opponent off. The last thing on their mind will be DTs hitting with the next warp in. So be sure to get stalkers instead of zealots. You\u0027ll have enough gas even while making stalkers so don\u0027t think you won\u0027t be able to warp them in with 2 rounds of stalkers.\n\nOne tricky thing to deal with is proxy oracle. Since this build skips the MSCore you won\u0027t have any defense back at home while you\u0027re doing your attack. The key to stopping this is scouting. You need to identify that he\u0027s proxying SOMETHING as soon as you can. If you only see one pylon in his base with your probe scout then that\u0027s enough. You\u0027ll need to deviate your build completely and go purely defensive. The first chronod stalker should be sent to look for the proxy. If you find it early enough you can actually depower the stargate before the oracle gets out. The next thing you need is a stargate right when you have 150 gas after the stalker. You can then get warp get and a 2nd stalker and chrono the 2nd stalker as well. You can decide to send the 2nd stalker to the proxy if you find it quick enough to try and keep it depowered or you can leave it home for extra defense if you don\u0027t feel like risking it. When the stargate is done you make a phoenix and chronoboost it and it will finish just as the oracle is coming into your base. If you depower the stargate then that\u0027s even better cause you can sometimes even fit in 2 phoenix before the oracle comes out. From there you can either do a 3gate phoenix all in to kill them, or just get 3 phoenix for harassment while getting a robo and expanding. If they go for blink after the oracle (which is pretty common) then you\u0027re going to want to do the 3 phoenix and robo response.\n\nIf you sniff out them doing a DT opener (1 gate, using all chrono, no signs of pressure at all, maybe find their probe trying to be sneaky and hide a pylon which will be a huge trigger since they opened so passively, see that a robo is finishing up as you start your pressure meaning he went DT/robo etc.) then you need to hide a robo on the map ASAP and also try to target their robo. If you notice it finishing as you start your pressure then you can kill it with the stalkers/DTs before an obs comes out. This is situational though as they may have sentries to FF it or have it tucked away where you can\u0027t reach it. If you can\u0027t kill the robo then just try to depower it or go straight for probes.\n\nPretty much any other opener and you\u0027ll be able to win with the aggression straight up. If they go fast robo then you might have to just contain them after you kill their expansion.","Name":"Stats 11gate 3gate into DT","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438338072338,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

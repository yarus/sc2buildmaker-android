The versatility of this build sets it apart from the other TvP openers: Polt’s build lets you defend, attack, or play off any shenanigans your opponent may through at you.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nThis build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponent’s first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.\r\n\r\nIf your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment.\r\n\r\nIf your opponent is going for a 2 Base Blink Stalker attack, then slow down your tech and gas income in favor of more units and more Bunkers. Start 2 Bunkers at the front and be ready to repair them with SCVs while you buy time for Combat Shields, more Marauders, and eventual Medivacs to pop.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  As you are taking map control with your initial Medivacs, be sure to add a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks, and finish getting Concussive Shells and Combat Shields. Add on another Engineering Bay and an Armory to continue your upgrades as soon as you can afford it.\r\n\r\nNote that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.\r\n- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper.  Do NOT lose your Reaper.\r\n- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.\r\n- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line.\r\n- Polt sometimes goes for an optional poke with his initial Marauder and several Marines if he has confirmed his opponent is not going for a Stargate. Be sure to keep these units alive – their only purpose is to take up a central Xel’Naga Watch tower\r\n- When transitioning into the midgame, setting up your infrastructure while being aggressive with your first few Medivacs can outright win you the game.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is strong because of the versatility inherent in its play. It makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game, gets up enough infrastructure to deal with all early and midgame attacks such as Oracle all-ins or Blink Stalker Timings, and then transitions into a completely standard bio midgame. It truly is an effective build to learn if you want to play safe and standard in TvP.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that it requires good scouting in order to take advantage of the versatility inherent in the build.","Name":"Polt Reaper FE into 3 Rax","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427974194314,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

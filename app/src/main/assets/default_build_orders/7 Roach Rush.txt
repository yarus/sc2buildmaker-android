It hits a very quick timing that can crush through inexperienced or unsuspecting opponents.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nThis build can be performed against any opener Terran has. The only scouting you need to do is send your initial 2 Overlords to your opponent’s base in order to spot both where your opponent is spawned and whether or not they have a Bunker or Marauders that you will have to break down or fight.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis 7 Roach Rush build is a strong 1 base attack that opens with a lot of units and few Drones, so your follow-up will be very slow. That being said, you should start to float some minerals as you are reaching your opponent’s base, so start a natural Hatchery, build a lot more Drones, and get Metabolic Boost as soon as possible. Going for a Lair and getting a Banelings Nest in order to start a Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk composition is a strong way to deal with Terran in the midgame.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is a strong 1 base attack that can crush your opponent early before they have their midgame even established. However, this build can be held off if your opponent scouts it and prepares with a repaired Bunker or Marauders if they have opened with a 1 base play of their own. It also is much less economical than any Hatchery First openers.","Name":"7 Roach Rush","Race":"Zerg","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428412609909,"VsRace":"Terran"}

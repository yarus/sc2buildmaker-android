In this one the initial zealot and MSCore are sent directly to the zergs 3rd to do some harassment. The whole goal of this build is to keep the drone count as low as possible before doing the full immortal/sentry push and this is stage 1 of that goal. You send the zealot/MSCore to his 3rd to maybe pick off a drone or even a queen but also to force an early set of lings. Losing the zealot will be almost inevitable however do NOT lose the MSCore. That will make your little poke 100% not worth it. You may not always be able to do this push as sometimes the zerg will open gas early and will have speed out by this time, so make sure you\u0027re scouting to see exactly when the gas goes down.\n\nPart 2 of the \"keep the drones low\" goal is with an early warp prism pressure. Most immortal/sentry all ins don\u0027t have this step in it, they just go right for the attack and let the zerg drone and make whatever he wants before the attack. This little drop of 1 immortal and 2 sentries (preferably behind the mineral line in an abusable location) forces even MORE things that aren\u0027t drones as well as allows you to kill a decent amount. If you\u0027re good with your micro as well you can keep the drop going by going into the main and doing a FF drop and warping in (as your first 4 gateways will be done at this time) however that option may not always be available. Also be sure to bring the MSCore with this drop, if things go terrible wrong you can always recall which is why it\u0027s important to not lose the MSCore in the initial poke.\n\nAll the while this pressure is happening you\u0027re going up to 3 immortals and 9 gateways and making a ton of zealot/sentry and moving across the map. If you can keep him pre occupied with the warp prism all the while you\u0027re moving across the map then that\u0027s even better. However your goal is complete at this point. You were successfully able to keep the zerg on a low drone count that isn\u0027t quite what they want to deal with an all in with this and forces a lot of units that they don\u0027t want to use in the engagement either. You then forcefield and a move to your eZ game eZ race victory.","Name":"HerO 2 base immortal warp prism pressure into immortal sentry all in","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438949429259,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

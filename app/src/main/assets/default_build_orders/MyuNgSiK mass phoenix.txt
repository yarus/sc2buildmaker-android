However the spin is that he gets 2 extra stargates after the 3rd goes down and continues making phoenix.\n\nOnce you get your 3rd up you\u0027ll have to be active in scouting with your phoenix to see what you should do to follow up. If you scout a heavy roach reaction to your 3rd, then you should instantly start chronoing void rays out of your 3 stargates. You can start getting immortals as well from the robo if you really think you can\u0027t hold.\n\nIf he goes for a hydra ling bust, then you need to continuously chrono phoenix. You don\u0027t try to get colossus up ASAP, that will just end in tears. Mass phoenix is EXTREMELY good vs lowish numbers of hydras. And when you are making as many as you are in this build, then that can extrapolate to medium numbers of hydras as well. Make sure you engage in smaller areas like ramps or in chokes if possible so you can abuse forcefields and timewarp/overcharge and lift all dem hydras up and laff at how their \"anti-air\" can\u0027t even kill air.\n\nIf you notice them being very greedy, with a fast 4th base and hardly any units, you can try to do a little timing with zealot/sentry and about 10-11 phoenix. It\u0027s not possible to do every game, and it may not kill them either, but if you notice an opening like that then just know there is a little timing you can do to abuse it.\n\nOnce your 3rd is set up you should be able to transition into colossus/void ray fairly easily or go straight to templar if you need to deal with fast vipers. Or you can get phoenix range and mass void ray to deal with muta/corruptor.","Name":"MyuNgSiK mass phoenix","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438943075886,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

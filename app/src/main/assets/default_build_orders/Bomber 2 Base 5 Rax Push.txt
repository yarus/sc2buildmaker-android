If he only has 1 gas before his stalker pops, check to see whether your opponent gets his natural at around 5:15 (You can hide your SCV nearby and then run it in around 5:30 to check for an expansion later if need be). If he has 2 gas or is not spending his chronoboost, then be wary of any sort of early attack.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- To confirm that your opponent is not all-inning you, have an SCV (or scan) go to his natural just before the 6 minute mark.  A 4gate will hit before this timing, but 2 bunkers and repair should be able to hold a 4gate easily enough; all other all-ins hit much later and this scout will give you enough time to mount an appropriate defense.\r\n- You cannot afford Marauders with this build until you start the Starport. The 100 extra minerals and 50 gas from making 2 Marauders at a time will slow down the push by over a minute.\r\n- Take map control when you initially poke out with your first two Medivacs. Do NOT engage Protoss yet though. This build sets up your infrastructure for a lot of reinforcements, but does not increase your army size until those reinforcements have actually arrived.\r\n- Once the first or second wave of units from all 5 Barracks have popped (you should be making 3 Marauders and 4 marines at a time), straight up fight Protoss’ army. Spread your army, kite Zealots, pick up units trapped between forcefields and zealots with Medivacs, and dodge storms as best you can. However, do not forget to build reinforcing units, and do not stop the aggression unless you are forced to. During this aggression, you also get to see what army composition your opponent has.  Get a 4th Refinery.  Then react appropriately to Colossus by making Vikings (and possibly a 2nd Starport) and to High Templar by making Ghosts.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nDuring the fighting, place down your 3rd CC, 2nd Engineering Bay and Armory, and Ghost academy or 2nd Starport to counter your opponent’s HTs or Colossi. Fighting your opponent across the map forces them to reveal which tech path they’ve gone down and safely give you the time you need to counter it before it comes to your base.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis 1rax FE variant cuts many early-game corners compared to other 1rax FEs.  Delaying the 2nd Refinery means that you cannot afford any Marauders at all until after your Starport has been started. Thus, in case your opponent does an early-game attack, you have to rely on Bunkers and SCVs to repair and tank damage much more than you would in other builds. However, what this build lacks in the early game it more than makes up for in the mid game. Getting five Barracks up that fast means that you can apply a lot of midgame aggression against your opponent.  With proper micro, it’s entirely possible to overrun the front with pure Marine/Marauder/Medivac even against Colossi or HTs, simply because of how many units you are reinforcing with.","Name":"Bomber 2 Base 5 Rax Push","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.0.5","VisitedDate":1428417120889,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

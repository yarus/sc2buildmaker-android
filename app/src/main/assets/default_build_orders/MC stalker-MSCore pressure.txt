You keep the zealot/MSCore home to help deny the early reaper if he goes for one. You start to go cross map when the 1st stalker comes out so that way everything is together and once the 2nd stalker comes then you run past the bunker. You don\u0027t want to go as each unit pops because then you let the terran 1) get the reaper in your base and 2) pick your units off 1 by 1. If you wait for everything to be grouped up it\u0027ll pack a bigger punch even if the terran might catch onto what you\u0027re doing. They simply don\u0027t have enough that early to really stop it from happening.\n\nDo your best to save the MSCore since that is the most important unit of the early pressure. Also be careful not to over commit. Losing all the stalkers is only worth it if you kill a considerable about of SCV\u0027s and marines.","Name":"MC stalker-MSCore pressure","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439383234688,"VsRace":"Terran"}

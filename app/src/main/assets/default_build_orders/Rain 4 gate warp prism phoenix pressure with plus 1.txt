It even incorporates an early zealot just in case. If you want you can get rid of the zealot if you know 100% that they won\u0027t be doing any form of speedling bust or whatever so that way you can get all the timings slightly quicker. However, for the added security the early zealot gives you outweighs getting the pressure at their base 5 seconds earlier for the most part. The build also gives off a very normal feel. A zerg will easily look at this and think it\u0027s a standard every day phoenix into colossus passive macro opening. This helps in with the attack later on.\n\nThere have been other variants of this kind of build that are slightly more all in, (sentry drop version, 7 gate version etc.) where if you do enough damage you\u0027ll be fine to macro out if you can\u0027t out right kill them however if you get shut down completely you\u0027re basically lose.This version only has 4 gates and zealots and gets a quicker robo bay in exchange so that way it still packs a big punch with the +1 and 8 zealots at once (4 warped in before loaded up and 4 warped in on location) while not needing to do an excessive amount of damage to be able to macro out of it afterwords.\n\nIn regards to actually macroing out of it, it\u0027s quite simple. Just start colossus production as your harassment is going on so that way if he tries to counter attack if the attack is held then you\u0027ll have something to defend a 3rd base easily. You should also try to squeeze in a few sentries if you notice the attack won\u0027t benefit from any additional warp ins.\n\nOr you can just do a follow up colossus all in if you want. Either works.","Name":"Rain 4 gate warp prism phoenix pressure with plus 1","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438781939745,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

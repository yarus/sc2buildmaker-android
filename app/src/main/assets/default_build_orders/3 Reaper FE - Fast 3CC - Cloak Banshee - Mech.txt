The reason I found this to be particularly interesting is because this build order looks like it will transition into bio for so long.\n\nThe build up to the transition point:\n\nWe use our 3 Reapers to scout and safely get up our 2nd CC: the 2nd Reaper can be rallied defensively if we suspect a pool first zergling run by. The 3 Reapers can then meet up and try to do damage: snipe queens, kill zerglings, kill drones etc. They retreat around 5:45 before zergling speed finishes and return with the hellions.\n\nIn this game Dream did not see Roaches early on and so he moved out with his Banshee to try to harass and force units.\n\nThe transition point:\n\nThe key differences are bolded in the build order. Specifically, getting Refineries 3 and 4, as well as the Armoury is the trigger to take us into Mech.\n\nThis transitional window means we need to be safe on the ground and safe against Muta’s until our first two Thors pop out. Build an engineering bay and Turrets covering your mineral lines and production facilities if you suspect 2 base Muta Play. Build 2 Tanks first if you suspect a Roach bust.\n\nOnce we have our Mech infrastructure up and running we simply need to control the map with our hellion force and make sure we use the right composition. A lot of this is situational so I won’t go into details.\n\nUse yout Banshees to draw queens into the main. You can runby into 3rd with hellions.\n\nTry to slow down the creep spread as much as possible This will allow you to push out without having to worry about too much creep spread.","Name":"3 Reaper FE - Fast 3CC - Cloak Banshee - Mech","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439476487328,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

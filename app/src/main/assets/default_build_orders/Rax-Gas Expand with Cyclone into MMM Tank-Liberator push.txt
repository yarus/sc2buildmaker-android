I usually scan the protoss base with the first 50 energy on my natural (right after the orbital finishes).\n\nI also build an engineering bay a bit after the bunker in case of DTs. The early economy that LotV provides opens up these options to be safe, but still secure a 2 base eco.\n\nThe reason that a cyclone is built is to stop protoss early game harass. A cyclone will kill adepts, stalkers, oracles, warp prisms, and basically anything they can send. It is not a 100% guarantee for safety though.\n\nAfter 1 cyclone is built, you can switch the tech lab to the barracks to start stim, this allows you to have an early stim too, along with the safety of the cyclone.\n\nThe tanks and liberators are so good in LotV because of the new photon overcharge design. Tanks and liberators outrange them. Use the liberators to zone out the protoss army, while using the tanks to take out pylons and slowly push into their base. This works best on maps with a large ramp into the natural.\n\nOnce you push far enough, the protoss will be forced to react and take all of the army and maybe even probes to the fight to try to hold you back.","Name":"Rax-Gas Expand with Cyclone into MMM Tank-Liberator push","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"3.0.0","VisitedDate":1448469326937,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

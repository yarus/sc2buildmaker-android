You open with 4 cyclones which provide powerful all-around early game defense and are the key to holding most forms of early aggression- stalker pressure, stargate units, fast warp prism, ect, so it\u0027s important you keep these alive.\n\nCommon mistake - overly aggressive cyclones: You get these first 4 cyclones very quickly and with the lack of mothership core, it\u0027s very tempting to try to get aggressive with them. The problem is, Stalkers are very good at kiting Cyclones atm, so you\u0027re putting the game into your opponent\u0027s hands, and you also need these 4 cyclones to deal with any warp prism shenanigans or more aggressive builds.\n\nCommon mistake - too many tanks: You really only need a core of ~8 siege tanks; I wouldn\u0027t go much higher than this unless your opponent is making non-chargelot based ground army.\n\nCommon mistake - too much hellion harass: Hellion harass is great and can do devastating damage, but if you trade out too many of your hellions vs a chargelot based composition, you\u0027re going to get boned come the main engagement.\n\nCommon mistake - surprise carriers: Once you\u0027ve saturated your third, you should start saving all your orbital energy for scans and keep a constant eye on your opponent\u0027s army composition and production. As soon as you see him start transitioning into carriers, it\u0027s time to attack.","Name":"Innovations Cyclone Mech","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1515766418219,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

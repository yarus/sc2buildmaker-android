With these two tools you can safely secure your main and natural from both frontal pushes and backdoor drops.\r\n\r\nBenchmark: When your first Colossus finishes (@9:00ish), you should have 1 Colossus, 3 Stalkers, a Sentry, a Mothership Core, 2 Observers, and around 50 Probes.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nThis build is a safe build that gets detection and a lot of early game Stalkers, so Probe scouting is unnecessary. Use your initial Stalkers to ward off any of your opponent’s Reaper(s) or scout the front of your opponent’s base if they are opening with a Command Center First.\r\n\r\nMost of your scouting will come from your 2 Observers. Send the first directly to your opponent’s main in order to spot what infrastructure is being built. Send the second to a common attack or drop path so that you have vision of when your opponent is moving out.\r\n\r\nAgainst early Widow Mine drops, position your units defensively and consider delaying Colossus production in favor of more Observers.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nWith Blink, Colossus, and Observers, you should be able to safely secure your main and natural expansions. Against bio play, consider getting 4 or 5 more Gateways while continuing your upgrades and taking your 3rd base as soon as you are safe to.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you are also able to go for a 2 Base, +2 Blink Stalker/Colossus all-in with this build.  Simply get your Ground Weapons upgrades instead of Ground Armor, and throw down 7 more Gateways after you start your Colossus production in order to break your opponent with simply Stalkers and Colossi.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Chronoboost your Nexii constantly in order to get an economic advantage.\r\n- Use your initial Stalker(s) to ward off any opposing Reapers and/or take a Xel’Naga Watchtower to see a push coming.\r\n- Position your Robotics Facility, Forge, and Twilight Council in a central location to prevent them from being killed during a drop.\r\n- Your Observers are the main way you can position your army to adequately defend multi-pronged aggression – replace them if they are scanned and lost.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build opens with both Blink Stalkers and Colossi, rushing for all the tools you need to defend Terran aggression.  With strong upgrades and a mobile unit composition, this build allows you to enter the midgame ridiculously quickly.\r\n\r\nHowever, with such investment in upgrades and tech, you have very little opportunity for aggression or much map control.","Name":"Harstem 1 gate FE to Blink-Colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972523615,"VsRace":"Terran"}

This build comes down to the gas count. You save up a lot of chrono early on to let the build flow and so that way you can chrono each phoenix as they start. By the time each chronod phoenix is finished you will have exactly 100 gas to start the next phoenix. After 4 chronod phoenix you will then have exactly 100 gas to start the robo and then 300 minerals left over for 2 gateways. If you do it perfectly, then you\u0027ll know when because it is very exact.\n\nThe idea is to get a RIDICULOUSLY fast stargate for phoenix to be able to scout exactly what your opponent is doing, and easily defend said thing that your opponent is doing. The build relies on the early phoenix and MSCore to keep you safe, however of course you\u0027ll need to do some adaptations to hold off certain styles. However the main premise behind the build is to set up a nice early game with easy scouting and an easy transition into the mid game with harass potential that normally would not be available.\n\nNow this build is obviously a complete hard counter to normal stargate openers. Your stargate is much faster than theirs so you can easily prepare for an oracle and you will always be ahead in the phoenix count. This pretty much forces them to either do a all in with stargate tech that you can easily poop all over, or go into delayed blink. This is then easily prevented with a robo for immortals as shown in Zest\u0027s game vs Trap. If it\u0027s an all in, then collect your free win. If not then just proceed into a normal macro game.\n\nIf you play vs someone going straight to blink, then a very similar response will be made. Again, the advantage to this build is that you will 100% see what they are doing so you can have enough time to prepare. Upon seeing the fast twilight for blink, (make sure it is blink instead of DTs. This can be determined by the gate count, the stalker count (or lack there of) and other timings from the early build.) you will stop at 2 or 3 phoenix and instantly throw down your robo and extra gates. You\u0027ll have to stay on 1 base for some time since it you obviously can\u0027t expand vs a 1 base all in. However this response is extremely similar to how you would deal with blink using the old HerO phoenix opener from WoL. In HotS now, the difference is that you have an early MSCore for overcharge and you can transition into the power house immortal/void ray composition that MC has shown to be quite effective.\n\nVs. DT\u0027s it\u0027s pretty obvious. You scout it early (because you can) and then make an oracle or very fast robo for detection and continue to expand like normal.\n\nVs. greedier expands you just take advantage of your early phoenix to harass him while getting your own expansion up and getting even through your phoenix harassment.\n\nThe hard part comes with 3gates/4gates and the like. Now I\u0027m not 100% sure of how to deal with this perfectly yet, however the best idea I (and FlatLine) could come up with is relying on the early overcharge (the reason you get the fast MSCore) and phoenix to lift units within range of the overcharge. Void rays would take too long to get out and are much slower.","Name":"Zest 11gate stargate","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438600605987,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

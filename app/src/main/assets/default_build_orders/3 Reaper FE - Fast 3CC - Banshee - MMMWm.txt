It is important to note that it’s difficult to both micro your reapers while not slipping in your macro. My approach to this problem is to memorize the crap out of my build order and then take it to the ladder. Knowing my build inside and out allows me to know exactly when to look back at my base, place a building or queue a unit and jump back to my reapers. It’s hard, but if you can’t do this you won’t advance into the higher leagues! Don’t let this stop you from using this build. In fact, using difficult builds is what promotes skill development! Accept the losses that result from trying something harder than you’re used to and just think of the time when you can run the zerg ragged without missing a beat at home! It’ll come with time!\n\nUnless you expect a super fast speed upgrade, head home with your reapers at 5:40. Speed should finish at 6:00. Wait for your 4-6 hellions until you contest map presence again.\n\nRemember that a bane, roach or speedling bust will require extra bunkers and SCV pulls. Look on this as a delay in your build. Knowing the build like the back of your hand will mean that once you’ve held the attack you can instantly go back to your build order without stress messing with your macro.\n\nThe cloakless banshee is there to hold these busts. Use it to target slow banes and to add dps against roaches. If you expect a macro play, feel free to try to get some drone kills. Not necessary but you may as well practice your banshee micro!\n\nThe early 3rd CC ensures that even if you lose 10-15 SCVs you’re still likely ahead of a bust oriented Zerg.\n\nMid Game and Beyond\n\nAfter you have your first two medivacs the game falls into the standard mid game phase: use multi pronged aggression to pull zerg away from his 4th and kill that base like your life depends on it (it literally does).\n\nDream used this build in his series vs Life in the GSL and in the SSL. It’s quite common.","Name":"3 Reaper FE - Fast 3CC - Banshee - MMMWm","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439476468453,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

With Reactor CC opener you would have more marines and same Cyclone timing.\n\nA downfall of this build is a lack of scouting tools. You should use scv for an initial scout. Then you can go away with Cyclone if you not expect Oracles to come.\n\nThis is macro oriented build with not a lot of midgame aggressive options but with very strong late game.\n\nGet 3 bases as fast as possible while staying safe, get your 2-2 upgrades. Start your aggression only after that. Add Liberators and Ghosts into composition based on enemy composition. Try to deny opponentÂ 4th base as much as possible.\n\n","Name":"Reactor CC into Cyclone safe 3rd","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"3.0.0","VisitedDate":1470914143737,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

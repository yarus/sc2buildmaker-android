It starts out with a similar idea of keeping drone count low with an early pressure before the actual all in. The zealot/stalker poke at the beginning this time is more to focus down queens than anything else, even if you get the health on it low that\u0027s better than nothing because the plan is to follow up directly after with the oracle. An oracle beats a queen one on one, however it will have low health, so if you can lower the queens health initially you can snipe it very quickly with the oracle after and get some juicy drone kills. Or best case scenario you actually kill the queen with the zealot/stalker and you just get a crap ton of drone kills.\n\nThis part is quite micro intensive so I would suggest practicing the timings of this build vs the AI multiple times first so you can get the timings for all the gateways down. However the follow up is extremely simple and doesn\u0027t require too much explanation. Try to sneak a probe out on to the map while the oracle is doing work so you can really surprise them with the follow up warp gate attack as soon as possible. You also get 1 or 2 void rays to clear out scouting overlords and to give a little extra meat to your army.","Name":"HerO oracle pressure into 7 gate void ray all in","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438950386416,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

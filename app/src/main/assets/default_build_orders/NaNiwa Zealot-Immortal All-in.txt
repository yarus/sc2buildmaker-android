As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery, you should be able to go through with this build.\r\n\r\nHowever, if your opponent scouts your Robotics Facility early on, then you can send your Warp Prism directly towards your opponent s base in order to both fake pressure and see what units/buildings they have made.  This Warp Prism poke provides a bit of scouting that may help you deduce what unit composition your opponent will try to defend your all-in with.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build is a 2base all-in, so there is no standard way to follow-up this build should the attack not outright win the game. If your opponent holds off your all-in without taking too much damage, then you will most likely lose the game soon after. That being said, starting more Assimilators and teching to either Colossi or Blink Stalkers (depending on what unit composition your opponent used to defend your all-in) for a second desperation all-in might just be enough to win the game.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- The limiting factor in this build is the Robotics Facility time. Be sure to chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out the Warp Prism and Immortals in time for such a fast attack.\r\n- Send your Warp Prism to your opponent s base as soon as it completes for both fake pressure and potential scouting information.\r\n- When you move out for the attack, be sure to fully wall-off your natural expansion (and even potentially build some cannons) to stop your opponent from running around your army and going for a base trade.\r\n- The most important part of the army are your Robotics units. Keep your Zealots all in front of your Immortals/Warp Prism so that they tank all (or most) incoming damage. Using the Warp Prism, pick up Immortals that are being targeted down to move them further back behind your Zealot meat shield. If your Warp Prism is being targeted down, bring it out of the fight and retreat a bit before warping in more Zealots.\r\n- If your opponent is trying to defend with Roaches or Mutalisks and you have a little extra gas, then mix in some Stalkers into the mix for some extra DPS.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis is a strong all-in that hits before your opponent can have much tech out in order to end the game quickly. With +1 Zealots dealing lots of damage to Zerglings, and Immortals shredding up Roaches, this build walks through most Zerg defenses with ease.\r\n\r\nHowever, none of your units are anti-air. Thus, if your opponent gets out Mutalisks before your attack has dealt lots of damage, then you will be in a lot of trouble. Also, losing a single Immortal or the Warp Prism due to poor micro can almost instantly lose you the game.","Name":"NaNiwa Zealot-Immortal All-in","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428424511916,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

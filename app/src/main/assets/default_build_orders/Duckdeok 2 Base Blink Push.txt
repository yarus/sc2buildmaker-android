Against Reaper play, keep your first Stalker on a common hop-up ledge in order to deny your opponent scouting the Twilight Council. Against other defensive play, poke out to your opponent’s front with your first Stalker and check to see whether your opponent is going for Widow Mines or a quick CC into Bio so you know how to micro when you Blink into his main base with all of your units.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build is a strong 2 base Blink Timing that commits a lots of resources to Stalkers and no resources to upgrades or tech, so your follow-up will be quite slow. If your attack does damage and you keep most of your units alive, then you can start 2 more Assimilators, 2 Forges, and a Templar Archives, in order to transition into a Chargelot/Storm unit composition with Blink Stalkers to help deal with drops. However, if you do not deal some damage with your initial Stalkers, then you will be behind both economically and in tech against an opponent who will have Stimpack and Medivacs soon to follow.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Do not bother Probe scouting early on because you can do this build against nearly everything your opponent chooses to open with.\r\n- With your initial Stalkers, either protect your main base from a Reaper scouting your Twilight Council or move out and poke up at your opponent’s base for some early scouting intel.\r\n- The limiting factor with this build is Blink Research’s build time and finishing your 6 Gateways, so be sure to Chronoboost Blink Research constantly in order to attack as soon as possible.\r\n- Keep your Mothership Core out of harm’s way.  Use its 14 sight range for high ground vision, but do not commit the Mothership Core in the attack because without high ground vision, your attack will most likely fail.\r\n- Do not forget to use your Mothership Core’s Time Warp ability to help pick off SCVs or Bio units that are out of position.\r\n- Do NOT over-commit your Stalkers in a risky blink. Only aggressively blink to get up to a high ground or to pick off a Siege Tank/Widow Mine before it activates.\r\n- Constantly warping-in more Stalkers to reinforce your army and add strength to the attack is key to crushing through your opponent’s defenses.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is a strong build because of how quickly you get both high ground vision with your Mothership Core and enough Blink Stalkers to do real damage – after opening with a 1gate FE. While your opponent might have Stimpack done in time for the attack, you can still beat your opponent in the open field if you use Time Warp and Blink appropriately.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build commits a lot of resources to the attack, so transitioning into standard play will be much further behind if you had just rushed for High Templars and upgrades. Also, if your Stalker positioning is sub-optimal, a Reaper may scout your Twilight Council and reveal the build before you have even moved out to attack.","Name":"Duckdeok 2 Base Blink Push","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972532759,"VsRace":"Terran"}

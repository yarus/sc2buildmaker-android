The dark shrine can be proxied or it can be put in base. On 4 player maps its best to proxy it since you can put the proxy in a base far away from theirs while already on your scouting path so it\u0027s pretty convenient and you can pull some cute mindgames with a fake chrono on the twilight to fake blink if they scout you.\n\nThis build is pretty much safe vs any opening. Vs fast WG attacks you use overcharge to buy enough time to get the DT\u0027s out so you can defend and harass at the same time and abuse their lack of detection. If they\u0027re smart they will see your lack of units and start a late robo or forge, however you can usually keep it from finishing with how early your DTs come out.\n\nVs standard robo expands your nexus will be a little bit later, however you can either make up for this by using warp prism/DT harass or doing the blink follow up to abuse their low production capability.\n\nVs blink you obviously just kinda win so that\u0027s always nice.\n\nStargate openers are the only real problem. If they go phoenix they will usually scout with the first one and will be able to pick apart what you\u0027re doing. In which case you can just play more conservatively and get extra gates before you expand to be sure you don\u0027t die to a phoenix/gateway all in. Use the DT to determine if he\u0027s expanding or not so you can react properly. If they bank the phoenix then you basically just win.\n\nIf they go for oracle pressure they sometimes can just win if they\u0027re good at identifying early and remember to leave an oracle at home. Otherwise you can usually hold it off decently well but it is definitely the most burdensome to deal with (besides proxy oracle, which just blows in general.)\n\nIf they go DT\u0027s too then you have that weird thing where you just kinda continue normally as if nothing happened. That\u0027s why you get the robo obviously so you don\u0027t die vs their potential DTs. In this case if you go for the blink follow up you can catch them really off guard since they\u0027re going to be transitioning into a more standard set up so their production capability is going to be very low.","Name":"DT-Robo into Archon-Blink push","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438607719338,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

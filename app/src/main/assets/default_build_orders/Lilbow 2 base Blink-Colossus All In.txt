This is still the super standard and passive blink style that gets only 2 gates instead of 3 early and a slightly earlier robo. Only chronos blink ONCE so that you can focus the rest of probes to get eco going for the 2 base play as early as possible.\n\nThis blink is by no means meant to be used aggressively. It is simply a defensive blink opener that can react to many different things and just be an overall safe opener. (You might want to go up to 3 gates if you scout them going factory after 1 rax FE in case they go for a marine/hellion drop so that you can be sure you have enough stalkers out) \n\nFrom there you get a robo bay for early colossus and spend all chronoboosts into that robo to get them out as quickly as possible. You also fit in some cannons to help defend vs drops. Even if he doesn\u0027t open widow mines, you can still afford them in the build so I don\u0027t see any downside to getting them no matter what for the extra defense. \n\nAfter that you simply get 4 more gates to go up to a total of 7 and then make only stalkers and colossus and brute force your way in with +1 attack behind you.\n\nWhy this late of an attack works\n\nSo basically this build pretends to be a really safe and passive opener. It looks like a passive blink/colossus opener that just defends and takes a slow third to stay extra safe. By the time a terran would be scouting and realizing that you aren\u0027t actually taking a third, the attack is going to be knocking at his door. It\u0027s simply a very oddly timed attack, but it hits at such a crucial point. This is basically when the terran\u0027s third should be getting saturated and his first wave of attempted aggression will have been deflected. You\u0027re hitting him in his transitional period between his 2 base set up and his 3 base set up: getting a few more barracks with add ons and his attempted switch into vikings. This is when the terran wants to sit for just a minute before being able to go for more rounds of aggression. If you trade very well earlier on when he tries to do some drops, then that just makes this timing even wider because he will have to keep making medivacs instead of vikings and will just in general have less units.\n\nThe reason why there\u0027s no zealots or sentries is because the build is focusing so much on anti drop defense early on. It\u0027s also an extremely brute force all in. It\u0027s meant to really jump into the terrans face and have high chasing power vs retreating medivacs and also to be able to drop vikings instantly. If you can keep the vikings from killing the colossus then they will do an absurd amount of damage with that early of a +1 attack. The large quantity of blink stalkers also makes it so that every unit you have is microable and savable. This isn\u0027t like most colossus all ins where it\u0027s just straight to colossus as early as possible. You have blink so you want to make use of it as much as possible.","Name":"Lilbow 2 base Blink-Colossus All In","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439209136974,"VsRace":"Terran"}

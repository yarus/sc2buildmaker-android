This way, you will not have to worry about early Zerglings because you will have a full wall. Thus, SCV scouting is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nYour first scouting comes from the first Hellions you make. With these Reactor Hellions, you can take map control, clears out any Zerglings at watchtowers, and pokes Zerg’s front to spot the Zerg’s third base, any buildings at the front, and any units that Zerg is making.\r\n\r\nIf you see a ton of Speedlings, then make sure your Hellion micro is on point. Feel free to pull back behind your natural wall in order to more effectively deal with Speedlings.\r\n\r\nIf you see Roaches, then immediately cut Reactor Hellion production and start making Widow Mines two at a time. Delay your Starport for a little while in order to afford Marauders, and consider cutting SCVs in order to complete a wall-off at your natural and prevent your opponent from running past your Bunker/Widow Mines.\r\n\r\nIf you see two Evolution Chambers, then assume your opponent is playing a macro game.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you see a third base, then you can also assume your opponent is playing a macro game.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build transitions pretty normally into standard Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play as well as Marine/Tank/Medivac play in a pretty common manner. However, because of the resources and time you have devoted to Bio units and upgrades, this build cannot transition into Mech.\r\n\r\nFor either the Bio/Mine or Marine/Tank transition, as you are pushing out, instantly start your 3rd Command Center, Combat Shields, and 2 Engineering Bays. It is also strongly suggested that you continue Medivac and Marine production before adding on more Barracks so that you can continue unrelenting drop play and keep your opponent on their half of the map while you are attempting to take your own third and get into your comfortable late-game infrastructure. When your Engineering Bays finish, be sure to start your Infantry upgrades, all of your Refineries, and throw down up to 5 more Barracks to be able to pump out your 3 base army.\r\n\r\nIf you are going for Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine play, be sure to start a Reactor on your naked Factory and start Widow Mine production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab for the Widow Mine upgrade once you have later secured your third).\r\n\r\nIf you are going for a Marine/Tank/Medivac play, be sure to start a Tech lab on your naked Factory and start Siege Tank production (adding a 2nd Factory with a Tech lab once you have later secured your third).\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Do NOT over commit with your initial Hellions. Use them exclusively for scouting purposes in the early game; their true purpose is to bolster your ground army in the actual Marine/Hellion/Medivac timing attack.\r\n- Against any all-ins with this build, you must rely on your Bunker placement, SCV control, and scouting it coming. Be active on the map with your first Hellions so that you know what is coming your way before it gets to your doorstep.\r\n- Feel free to push out with your Bio army even before Stimpack/Medivacs are even done. As long as you have Hellions scouting in front to ensure you are not being all-inned, your Bio army can be walking across the map while your Medivacs boost in behind them so that you hit your opponent the second Stimpack finishes.\r\n- Do NOT clump up against Banelings. Your opponent should not be able to have that many Banelings by the 9 minute attack, but be sure to spread your army and micro appropriately if you see Banelings on the field.\r\n- Remember to pick up your Marines into the Medivacs and boost away as soon as your army is finally overtaken. Keeping your opponent on their side of the map while you set up your own third base is crucial.\r\n- Save at least one scan to kill creep. As a Zerg, losing your initial midgame creep and a Queen or two spreading it can be devastating for the later stages of the game.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build opens quite economically, and then transitions into making a strong army and hitting your opponent with a lot of units at the 9 minute mark before they can even stabilize their third base economy. It is a very strong build for punishing greedy Zergs.\r\n\r\nHowever, while it is a CC First opener that is not at all all-in, it is definitely not nearly as macro-oriented as the standard Reactor Hellion 3CC build or other 3CC builds such as Polt’s Map Control Build. Also, if your opponent can see it coming and overproduces units to defend, you will have to pick up and rely on drop play instead of a large frontal assault to get an advantage.","Name":"Maru 14 CC to MMMH Timing","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428397594274,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

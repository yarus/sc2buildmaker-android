In this build DnS goes for twilight before robo which is the only slightly risky thing about this build. However, if you see them doing some sort of proxy or other one base play you will know before you put this down so you can exchange it for a robo to be safe vs those types of openings. Besides that, going for twilight first is generally very safe. Cyclone pushes can be held with the larger stalker count early and shield batteries, and hellion run byes are easily swatted away by proper building placement at the front of the natural with your 2nd pylon and extra two gateways. If you are unsure what might be coming across the map, then leave a probe out in the middle on a watch tower or on the path they\u0027ll most likely take to see if you need to make shield batteries or not.\n\nAfter the extra gates you can make another pylon and also your robo to start making observers for extra vision. You also get your 3rd gas with the robo. You don\u0027t really need the 4th gas this early and it helps the build flow a bit better if you don\u0027t make it, however if you don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to remember to get it later on then it\u0027ll be fine to get at this time. Then once warp gate is done you\u0027ll warp in two rounds of stalkers for a total of nine with blink being done around 4:35 after three chronoboosts on it. With these stalkers you can easily defend any mine drop or liberator harass from the terran and then immediately counter attack to put on some light pressure. A cute alteration you can do with this build is chrono out a warp prism instead of an observer and put on some heavier pressure with more stalkers if you want to really punish a greedy terran or if the terran was wasteful with their early units.\n\nBehind the light pressure you\u0027ll be taking your 3rd base and your two forges to scale into the mid and late game. At least two sentries should be made as well for guardian shield in any fights. Then once the forges are done you should start your upgrades and put a majority of your chronoboost into them. Along with the upgrades should be charge and the start of your immortal production which should remain as consistent as possible. At 6:00 you can start the first gateway flood with three gates and then once those are done DnS makes a whole extra five. I believe this is mostly because he scouted that Bunny was continuing with a prolonged two base all in and if this were not the case then he would have only gotten an extra 2-4 with a faster Templar Archives. Even with the prolonged all in, DnS goes for a 8:00 4th base with the templar archives a bit after that so sometime around then is a good time for those.\n\n","Name":"DnS 3gate blink pressure into double forge","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1514919787793,"VsRace":"Terran"}

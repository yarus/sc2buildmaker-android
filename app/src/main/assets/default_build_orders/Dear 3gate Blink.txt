It produces a healthy Stalker count to apply pressure to your opponent or safely secure your expansion against any all-in.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nBeing active with your initial Stalker around your natural and third will help keep you aware of any super early aggression. Just be sure to pull your Stalker(s) back to the protection of your Sentry quickly if you have to defend an early attack.\r\nThe majority of your scouting comes from your Hallucinated Phoenix. Your phoenix should be able to get into your opponent’s main base and determine what tech route you see your opponent going.\r\n- If your opponent is expanding quickly, then consider warping in Stalkers non-stop from a proxy Pylon as you all-in your opponent with a Blink all-in. Should you choose to expand instead, you will be slightly behind economically – but with Blink.\r\n- If your opponent has a Robotics Facility, then be sure that you do NOT over produce Stalkers.  Instead, expand and fall back to a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame.\r\n- If your opponent has a Stargate, then be sure to not take damage against early Phoenix or Oracles by initially positioning your Stalkers defensively. You can expand quite easily behind your Blink play and go into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon midgame or all-in your opponent if you spot them taking a fast expansion behind the Stargate.\r\n- If your opponent has a Twilight Council, then consider getting a Robotics Facility instantly in order to make one Observer for detection against DTs. If you are sure your opponent is also opening with Blink, then constantly produce Immortals and defend a natural expansion OR skip the Robotics Facility entirely and try to win the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker micro war.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build is a very safe opener that allows you either to all-in your opponent with Blink Stalkers or transitions into a macro game quite easily. However, the actual steps you take to transition into it often depend completely on what tech choice your opponent has chosen to open with. This is why scouting with the Hallucinated Phoenix and generally being active on the map with your Blink Stalkers is crucial.\r\nIf you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly produce Stalkers 3 at a time from your proxy Pylons and attack as soon as Blink Research is finished (@7:40ish). Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home – using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.\r\nIn Twilight vs Stargate macro games, abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you have a strong midgame Chargelot/Immortal/Archon army ready. In Twilight vs Robotics macro games, again abuse your mobility to keep your opponent from ever moving out before you get a healthy Chargelot/Archon count up.  Keep tabs on your opponent’s tech switches so that you transition into a late game army appropriately. In Twilight vs Twilight macro games, defend your opponent’s potential Blink or Dark Templar harass by getting a Robotics Facility and producing Observers/Immortals or by winning the Blink Stalker vs Blink Stalker position battles in the open field.\r\nThe most common way to start the transition into Chargelot/Immortal/Archon is by starting a 2nd Nexus, a Robotics Facility and 2 more Assimilators, a Forge for +1 Ground Weapons, and Zealot Charge research in that order. Add on the Templar Archives and Archons when you can afford it.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Once you start your Mothership Core, save your chronoboost so that you can dump it all into Blink Research. Only 1 or 2 chronoboosts should be spent on Warpgate (unless you spot your opponent going for very early aggression).\r\n- Poke around your natural and third base with your initial Stalkers to make sure your opponent is not performing a very early attack (such as a 4gate or Trap’s 3gate All-in).\r\n- Against Stargate play, be sure to position your units to defend your mineral line from potential Oracle or Phoenix harass.\r\n- If you choose to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly chronoboost Blink and then later your Gateways to get the maximal amount of units out with Blink as soon as possible. Bait out a Planetary Nexus and/or kill the Mothership Core and as many Sentries as possible before fully committing to an attack. If your opponent is on one base, you can still expand at home – using your Sentry to force field the ramp to stop his army from coming down and engaging you with his entire army.\r\n- If you choose to expand behind this build, do not produce more than 8 Stalkers which you should use to take map control and poke your opponent’s front. Once you are safely in the midgame, go back to chronoboosting Probes to fully saturate two bases. Transitioning into a Chargelot/Immortal/Archon unit composition is very strong.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is a versatile, aggressive build that can pressure your opponent or defend basically any all-in with Blink Stalkers. It gets a fast Hallucinated Phoenix scout your opponent’s main base and let you know if you need detection, should reposition your army, or all-in your opponent.\r\nHowever, this build requires a lot of scouting information to be executed effectively, so getting a Hallucination into your opponent’s base is crucial. Also, any build with Blink Stalkers requires a lot of APM, so this build is not meant for newer players.","Name":"Dear 3gate Blink","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427978802054,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

Then follow up with your Reaper scout, checking pylon count, assimilator count, gas mined, and MSC/Stalker/Nexus timing.\r\n\r\nYour early Engineering Bay allows for equally early Missile Turrets, so you should be able to build a turret in your main base and position marines in your natural mineral line in the event of an Oracle attack.\r\n\r\nAgainst a delayed Protoss expansion (4:10+, no Nexus), always build a bunker.\r\n\r\nAgainst a fast expanding Protoss, poke with your first Marauder and 8-10 Marines to force overcharge and to gauge his army size.\r\n\r\nThis initial poke will reveal the following possibilities:\r\n\r\n- Little to no Gateway units: Possible double forge (proceed as normal) or Dark Templars (build turrets and bank one scan minimum).\r\n- No obvious Observers: Confirm Twilight tech. If your opponent is going for Templar instead of Colossus, immediately abandon the build and do a biomine parade style using a reactored Factory and five barracks before your third Command Center. SCV pulls are a poor choice against Pisonic Storm.\r\n- More Stalkers then usual: Possible Blink Stalker aggression. React accordingly with bunkers and mines. Consider hiding your small poke squad at his third or fourth, and counter attacking when he moves all his stalkers and his MSC to your side of the map.\r\n- Phoenixes: Phoenix Colossus is by far the most likely choice, but constantly scout to see if the Colossus count is rising. If it remains at one or two for very long, be cognizant of the possibility of a feint into Templars.\r\n- Healthy Gateway unit count: Proceed as normal.\r\n\r\nThese above are only a few examples, but the most common. Against most styles that involve Colossus (single forge, double forge, blink colossus, phoenix colossus, etc) you will be able to simply play as normal and execute the all in without any problems.\r\n\r\nFor lower level players, please be advised all scouting reactions as written above are general assumptions made against players attempting optimal strategies. You will be blindsided by sub optimal and often illogical strategies quite often, but you should be able to compensate with superior macro and mechanics.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nAs with any all-in, there is no transition unless you have done a significant amount of damage.\r\n\r\nIf your attack fails, there is no transition; you will die almost immediately to any counter attack, or you will be contained to two bases and slowly starve to death.\r\n\r\nIf your attack succeeds in mostly destroying Protoss’s army, but you cannot finish off your opponent, retreat and rally defensively. Continue your upgrades, maintain consistent worker production, and add a third command center and a Ghost Academy, if necessary.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this push is to successfully engage and destroy his army decisively. Your SCVS are there to absorb just enough Colossus volleys to allow your Vikings to destroy all the AOE and your MMM to shoot through the Gateway buffer.\r\n\r\nAgain, to emphasize, your objective is to destroy his army decisively, not to destroy his third, or his natural, or snipe any tech. You are to take one crushing victory with your army before beginning to do any eco or tech damage.\r\n\r\nDuring the actual engagement, be sure to have your SCVs in front of your main army. Attack in as wide of a concave as you can form, and make sure that your Vikings are shift A-clicked across his Colossus.\r\n\r\nDo not attempt any drops or secondary attacks. Your attack needs to be as strong as possible along a single front for the highest chance of success.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThe first ten minutes of this build, as mentioned above, are identical to a standard Reaper FE, making this a particularly tricky all in to scout. Additionally, this build has the benefit of blind countering some two base Colossus all-ins because it gets Vikings so quickly, and in such high numbers.\r\n\r\nThat being said, just as with any all-in, if scouted and identified, this build loses a lot of its potency. A faster than normal Templar transition and increased Sentries for force fields are both popular and effective responses against scouted SCV pulls.","Name":"INnoVation 2 Base SCV Pull","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972297258,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

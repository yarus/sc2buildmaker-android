Its versatility has stood the test of time, and the current version below will be continually updated as INnoVation continues to optimize it again and again.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nYou can open with this build regardless of what your opponent is doing, so SCV scouting is unnecessary. You only need to SCV scout if you want to confirm that your opponent is opening Hatchery First and want to start a Bunker at their natural in order to begin Reaper/Bunker pressure.\r\n\r\nThe rest of your scouting will come from your Reapers and then later Reaper+Hellions poking the front and forcing your opponent to reveal what units they have in order to defend your attacks. Note: Ling Speed will finish around 3 minutes after your opponent takes an Extractor. Thus, if your initial SCV/Reapers see your opponent taking gas, be sure to send your Reapers back just before those 3 minutes are up and wait for some Hellions before attempting to engage Speedlings in the open field.\r\n\r\nIn case your Reapers or Hellions spot your opponent making Roaches or going for a Roach Warren, immediately cancel your next pair of Hellions and begin making Widow Mines and Marauders. Having your Widow Mines positioned effectively, and using SCVs to tank damage or repair your Bunker will be all you need to stay alive.\r\n\r\nBe prepared to throw the timings of the second half of this build out assuming any serious aggression, such as a Roach Bane all-in.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build transitions well into both Marine/Tank or Marine/Marauder/Medivac/Mine because it sets up the basic infrastructure needed for either of those and gets Stimpack.\r\n\r\nThe above transition involving double barracks after hellions followed by double ebay is the standard transition. In the event of an extreme all in, such as Roach bane, immediately begin marauder, mine, and bunker production. Against a strong Roach timing it is advised to begin tank production while slightly delaying either your Starport or Engineering Bays; this is most demonstrated notably in INnoVation’s series against Hyun in the WCS 2014 Global Finals.\r\n\r\nAnother great transition if you have done some damage with your Reapers or Hellions is going for a Hellbat/Marauder follow-up attack. How Dragon does this is throw down an Armory as soon as you start your 3rd Command Center, and then make Hellbats constantly as soon as the Armory finishes.  Starting two Engineering Bays and going for a +1/+1 Marauder/Hellbat push is a great way to keep up the aggression against your Zerg opponent. Keep in mind that this sort of 3CC Hellbat aggression is far weaker than a two base committed Hellbat push.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build was originally intended as an aggressive opener backed by strong macro. In modern TvZ, however, any competent Zerg player will easily deflect Reaper Hellion pressure with minimal losses, and gasless three hatches are becoming increasingly rare due to the benefits provided by opening either Speedlings or Roach aggression. As such, the major pro of this build should now be listed as the amount of information that the Reaper can provide; because Zerg cannot proxy any tech, you should be aware of what Zerg is doing most of the time. In this way, opening Reaper/Hellion is inordinately safer than simply opening Hellions, if only because of the information difference.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this build traditionally had been hyper aggressive openers, such as fast Speedling rushes (which can be deterred by bunkers between your 2nd CC and your main ramp), Roach/Bane busts (which can be held with bunkers, repair, and either mines or hellions with Marauders), or even fast Muta play (which INnoVation countered by simply pushing at his normal time with three missile turrets at home).\r\n\r\nThe new biggest threat against this build, however, is Roach timings. Simply put, this build focuses very heavily on Hellion production, and delays all other AOE quite significantly (usually up until around 11+ minutes). As such, 1-1 Roach Busts, or fast 2-2 Roach Hydra max out attacks, or even Roach Hydra into Brood Lords are all excellent examples of builds in which players should quickly identify, cut Hellions, and immediately begin adapting their builds for the situation.\r\n\r\nLearning this Build and the Difficulty Curve\r\n\r\nThis build is undoubtedly one of the hardest macro builds to learn in the game. Besides it’s extreme adherence to timings and linear sequences, it is also extremely punishing in every aspect; INnoVation has refined this build to the point of impracticability; over queueing means delaying Hellions; delaying Hellions delays your Barracks, delaying your Barracks delays your starport, and delaying your starport delays your entire 1-1 push. In short, a single mistake has many more long lasting impacts as opposed to a standard Terran build.\r\n\r\nTo go about learning this build, it is important to work on only one section at a time and to not try to do everything at once when you first start off, else you will immediately fail.\r\n\r\nIn the order of things to focus on (#1 being top priority, and #8 being the lowest priority)\r\n\r\n1. Worker Production\r\n2. Not getting supply blocked, not over queueing, and proper rallies for all structures\r\n3. The build itself (for example, starting Hellions before 5:30, or double E-bay and 2nd gas geyser at 7:40) and its relevant timings\r\n4. Taking your Third base on time\r\n5. Scouting\r\n6. Keeping your Reaper Hellion alive\r\n7. Harassing\r\n8. Micro (Sniping the first creep tumor, catching the transfer of drones to the third base, weakening Queens to force transfuses and decrease tumors, sniping active tumors, runbys, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn short, always defer to the priorities, and only move down the line as you can accomplish the others. Even if you kill 32 Zerglings with your Hellions, it is irrelevant if you Medivacs finish at 12 minutes instead of 10:20. Even if you land your third base at 8:30, it is irrelevant if you only have 26 SCVs at the time instead of 40-50 that INnoVation might have. And even if you plant every structure down perfectly at the allotted times, supply blocks, over queueing, poor rallies, and suboptimal worker distribution also grind this entire build to a screeching halt.\r\n\r\nFocus on one step at a time, and continually re watch INnoVation’s replays of this build from his view to fully internalize the mechanics and decisions that make this build brilliant.","Name":"INnoVation Reaper-Hellion 3CC","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972470412,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

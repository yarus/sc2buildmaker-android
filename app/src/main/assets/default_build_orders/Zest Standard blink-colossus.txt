Grab many observers and use them for map vision so that you can react well with your army positioning. This allows you to stay safe while teching hard towards 2/2 and securing a powerful Colossus based army.\n\nEarly Game Reactionary Play:\n\nZest’s play style is the most reactive of any Protoss I have ever seen. On Merry Go Round where he cannot ensure that he scouts MMA’s position first he opts not to scout and finishes his first Zealot in case of something cheesy coming from MMA. In the second game on Overgrowth he scouts after gateway and determines that he is facing a CC first. Then he takes an early Nexus without gas or cyber to keep himself economically even.\n\nObservers:\n\nScout opponents base \nIn front of your main \nMain base perimeter #1\nMain base perimeter #2: Here you may need to add an addition pylon to help spot if the surface area on your base is too great. Zest does this on Merry Go Round but not on Overgrowth. It is safe to assume that Zest builds the 5th observer as a replacement for his first observer which was scanned. He also stops at 4 in the second game. Creating this 5th observer delays the colossus timing and so avoiding this if possible is the most optimal way to play. However, the fact that Zest does make the 5th observer in the first game suggests to us the important of map vision with this build. A later colossus is a fair trade to secure the vision you need to position your powerful yet fragile army perfectly.\n\nHard counters: This strategy is countered better by maps than by a specific strategy. If the map has a lot of dead space by the main it is extremely hard to cover it with vision. Zest does make 5 observers in his first game vs MMA but this is not optimal and using a strategy like Jim’s Phoenix build may be the best bet for denying drops on these maps.\n\nChrono Boost after Saturation: Prioritizing upgrades here allows you to secure 2/2 as soon as possible. This lets you hold timings with SCVs or a large Viking count much easier than if you stay on 1/1 too long with a higher unit count.\n\nReactions: The key reaction here is 3/3. Zest waits until he has deflected Terran’s timing at his 3rd to start 3/3. He also delays Templar tech and continues colossus production in the first game which allows him to hold an SCV pull. However, in the second game he cuts colossus after 3 and techs immediately towards charge and storm. I believe the information he obtains from scouting their 3rd after making his own nexus (12:00) gives him the information as to what type of terran play he will be dealing with. The first game he sees that terran has no taken gas at his 3rd and so he does not tech towards Templar, in the second game he sees the gases and immediately starts a Templar archives and warp prism (units which would not help vs an imminent SCV pull).","Name":"Zest Standard blink-colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439377129197,"VsRace":"Terran"}

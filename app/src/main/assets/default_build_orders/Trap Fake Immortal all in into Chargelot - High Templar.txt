So not only is it safe vs basically any opener the Terran can do, it looks totally standard and adds an extra bit of mind games on top of the fake all in. The 2 stalkers will keep you safe vs any sort of early pokes and if you see them doing a gas first opener then you just follow up with your normal response with the robo for observers and what not. I prefer following up with a DT drop after gas first openers, but you can still try to do the build after you defend as well.\n\nThe build skips gateways for a while so if he\u0027s doing any sort of really crazy aggressive push then you\u0027re banking on the immortals and overcharge to keep you alive. Don\u0027t be afraid to show the immortals if you really need them to defend early on, because this build is all about mind games early on so them seeing the immortals is honestly not even that big of a deal because it can force them to go super defensive even earlier than normal which will only benefit you.\n\nThe fake attack + Mid game transition\n\nSo once warp gate is done you\u0027re gonna be warping in only sentries. Trap goes up to 5 which is a good amount where if the Terran sees that many they\u0027ll still think you\u0027re all inning but not so much that it hinders any chance of transition.\n\nNow one more thing I should note about the push is that there is a vulnerability to 3 rax openings. Since your gate count comes in so late, if you move out on the map with only the first few units and they opened 3 rax then you\u0027re probably gonna get caught out and lose. So if you notice they open 3 rax while doing this build, just start your move out after you warp in the sentries at home instead of going across right away. You might even need to defend with the immortals before you can attack if they go soon enough.\n\nThe transition is quite simple to pull off if you scare the terran. You get charge and the templar archives right when the twilight council is done and you also continue making probes the entire time you were doing the fake attack. So by the time you\u0027re transitioning you\u0027ll be fully saturated. The transition is very easily defended because even if the terran doesn\u0027t fully buy into your fake attack, if they still try to attack themselves after then the 5 gates worth of units and 2 immortals you made is SO helpful in defending. 5 sentries do wonders to split up small amounts of bio and you should be just fine against any kind of counter pressure if they do it at all. You also get a warp prism after the observer so that if they do try to counter attack then you have a nice 4 zealot drop going on in their main at the same time.\n\nFrom there just chrono the storm and try your best to keep it a secret. Storm is always great if they don\u0027t know about it for as long as possible. You can then come out of no where with 5+ HT\u0027s full of energy with them having no idea about it and you just get a free win.\n\nLate game\n\nIf you don\u0027t get the eZ free win then you can just continue on like with any normal PvT opening. You can make a quick tech over to colossus since he will have identified the HT\u0027s late. This gives you extra time to transition over since he\u0027ll be setting up to go into anti HT mode for a while. If you can get the 3rd up and get storm out without taking any damage, you should be 100% fine to go into the later stages with a large tech advantage. Just remember to keep an HT or two per base for back up storms with some cannons to help vs drops as well and you should be good.","Name":"Trap Fake Immortal all in into Chargelot - High Templar","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439217435253,"VsRace":"Terran"}

You either should target and timewarp the queens he has trying to defend the 3rd, and then clean them up with the oracle, or bait them all down and then go in to a queenless mineral line to get a ton of drone kills. It\u0027s all up to your judgement.\n\nAfter that youcgo for very fast charge, archons, and +1 attack and then zealot/archon timing to kill the 4th base of the zerg. It hits at such an awkward time that the zerg never expects it and you\u0027re taking a 3rd behind it as well so they don\u0027t even think you\u0027re going to attack.\n\nThe other reason it\u0027s so good though is because zealot/archon at that stage in the game is probably the best unit comp per cost vs anything the zerg could have made. If they try to go for mass lings at that stage to hold off the zealot pressure, then zealot archon is obviously going to destroy that. If they go for hydras the count won\u0027t be high enough and as long as you can trap them with FF\u0027s you\u0027ll destroy them as well. If they go roaches then you probably can\u0027t end them with this push, but if you can get good forcefields and get the zealots in the faces of the roaches then you\u0027ll do quite well since zealots are actually better vs roaches if they can get in their face (which is what charge + FF does). If they go swarm hosts you\u0027ll hit right as they\u0027re popping usually so they\u0027ll be in quite low numbers. You can do a good amount of damage before you have to pull back to an observer from the robo you made while pushing. The only big trouble with this build is mutas, however like the swarm hosts you\u0027ll be hitting as they pop. With 3-4 archons and a wave of stalkers afterwords you can easily deal with low numbers of mutas. If they are able to get a good 12-13 at once you\u0027re gonna have to back up and immediately make 2 extra stargates and start phoenix production.\n\nIf you don\u0027t end the game with the zealot/archon push then you can simply transition into whatever tech is required vs what the zerg chose. You can start warp prisms with the robo you made and then go into colossus and blink, or you can make warp prisms and continue down TC path with storm and then add some void rays.\n\nThis build is very aggressive but without being all in in the slightest, it really puts you in a good position early on and doesn\u0027t let the zerg max on drones and get their dream composition, you are definitely in control of the game with this build.","Name":"HerO 3 gate oracle pressure into chargelot-archon","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438866791336,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

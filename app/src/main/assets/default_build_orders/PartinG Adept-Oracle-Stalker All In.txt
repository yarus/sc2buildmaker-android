Cybercore timed in that way so you would have enough resources to get 2 adepts and Warpgate right after Cybercore completed. With first 2 adepts you can poke Terran base and try to harras if there is a chance to hit Terran economy.\n\nNext step of the build is to build proxy pylon and add Stargate with 2 additional gates so you would have total 4 gates and 1 starport from 1 base.\n\nGet first Oracle and try to kill scvs but not lose your Oracle. Switch your 4 gates to Warpgate and warp first 4 Stalkers. Push Terran with your Adepts, Stalkers and Oracle while building 2nd Oracle and warp additional 4 Stalkers.\n\n","Name":"PartinG Adept-Oracle-Stalker All In","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"3.8.0","VisitedDate":1448980055177,"VsRace":"Terran"}

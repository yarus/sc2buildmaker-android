It\u0027s a nexus first into gateway. If you don\u0027t want to play that greedy you can still do a similar version of the build off of a FFE, it\u0027ll just hit a tad later and you may want to just adapt it to be not as all in.\n\nThe build itself is quite simple. You get a fast nexus, go into 1 gate for sentry production to stay safe/build up energy, expand, make more gates, and then attack with mass sentry/stalker at an awkward time for the zerg to deal with. There isn\u0027t TOO much to explain with this one as it all comes down to execution.\n\nThere are a few reasons behind getting the fast 3rd even if you aren\u0027t actually transferring probes to it.\n\n1) It fakes the zerg out. When they see that early of a Nexus they\u0027re going to do one of two things. They will either make mass units to try and kill it (which is fine since you\u0027re going to have 7 gates worth of production and a bunch of sentries) or they go heavy econ and drone up hard (which is also good because then they don\u0027t have units to defend the attack).\n\n2) It provides a back up plan. If the attack doesn\u0027t go 100% as planned, you can always start making probes 3 at a time and transfer them down while starting to tech up. That way if things ever go wrong you aren\u0027t 100% all in (hence the \"semi\" from earlier).\n\n3) Extra chronoboost for gateways. A small addition, however a nice one if you can spend your chronoboost well.\n\nA small note that I feel would be a good addition to this build that coincides with the 2nd point above. I think as you are moving out (or as your +1 is finishing) you should get a twilight council as well. This makes it easier to transition into +2 blink and beyond if your initial pressure can\u0027t finish them off and since the build itself doesn\u0027t starve you for money, there is no harm in getting it.\n\nThe other benefit to this build is that you don\u0027t even have to all in with it if you don\u0027t want to. You can do the same opener and if you see the zerg being greedy and you want to play greedy too, then by all means go for it. You took a 6:50 3rd base. While I still suggest pressuring at least a little bit (to maybe deny the 4th) you can still be probing up constantly behind it and teching as well. It\u0027s a very flexible build due to the early sentries.","Name":"PartinG Fast 3 base 7 gate","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438855548080,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

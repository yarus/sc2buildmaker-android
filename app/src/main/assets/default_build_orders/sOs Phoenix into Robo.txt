Something that sOs doesn\u0027t do in his build is get an early stalker. I feel like it\u0027s a bit risky/greedy to do this and I feel more comfortable adding the stalker in, so I did. The small impact this has is that your 3rd phoenix will have a delay on it. It\u0027s not the biggest of deals in my opinion and I feel like it\u0027s better to feel safer with the early stalker to help try to scout for proxies and whatnot.\n\nThe robo comes early enough so that way DTs are not a problem at all. You\u0027ll easily be able to scout the dark shrine with your phoenix, the observer should come out right as the DT is getting to your base and you can easily lift it and not lose a single unit. From there you\u0027ll have free reign over his probe line with your phoenix.\n\nFor the most part you should be getting your Nexus as early as possible right after the first warp in. Unless you think they\u0027re doing a 1 base all in there\u0027s no real reason to start the immortal before the nexus. In sOs\u0027 game vs Creator it seemed like he wasn\u0027t 100% certain if Creator was going to try and blink all in or not, so he played it safe and got the immortal before the nexus.\n\nReactions to certain builds\n\nEarly gateway timings\n\nThese are the only tricky things to stop with this build. Since you\u0027re not really making any units it\u0027s obvious that a 4gate might be a little hard to stop. The best thing you can really do is to identify that it\u0027s happening asap (with your probe scout) and prepare by getting 3gates of your own and going into void rays. You\u0027ll have to use overcharge to buy time for everything to finish and you\u0027ll need some fancy micro. Don\u0027t be afraid to pull probes right away to catch him off guard and get a surround off. Early probe pulls can be really good since their unit count isn\u0027t totally out of control and it can really swing the edge in your favor quickly since 4gates really only have 2 warp in cycles or so until they stop being effective. This will also force them to back away and allow your void ray to stay targeted for a while dealing out some extra damage. It\u0027ll have to be a dance, but it\u0027s definitely possible.\n\nStargate openers\n\nIt\u0027s really quite simple. If your stargate is faster than theirs and you get the phoenix out first, you should win easily. Take control of the skies and force them onto the ground and you can either follow up by taking an early nexus and harassing like normal, or throwing down 2 extra gates and try ending it with a phoenix/gateway all in. This is very effective since they will only have gateway tech available to them since the tech they invested in got shut down completely. If you get 4-5 phoenix and just lift up 4-5 units, all of a sudden half his army isn\u0027t in the fight and it\u0027s an easy win.\n\nIf their stargate is faster than yours, be sure to identify that right away. This stargate is basically the fastest possible off a normal opening, so the only thing faster than yours is an 11 gate stargate which you should be able to scout before you even drop you own stargate. So you can switch to blink if you want and go from there.\n\nBlink openers\n\nThis is also quite simple since you are getting such a fast robo. Make sure to identify whether they\u0027re going for an all in or a macro build. If it\u0027s an all in, then simply start making immortals ASAP and chrono them out while using the phoenix to deny any high ground vision and just forcefield for days. They will probably try to contain you, so keep the phoenix alive. Once you have a few immortals you can lift the sentries they have so you can bust down the ramp and force them away and take an expansion. Try to do this as early as possible so their expansion isn\u0027t too far ahead of yours and so they don\u0027t have like 3-4 sentries there.\n\nEarly robo expands\n\nWhile they will have a faster expansion than you, you have full map control. This is where this build truly shines. Three phoenix can do wonders to a mineral line that\u0027s not easily defended. Even though their expansion will be quicker, it won\u0027t even matter because of the amount of damage you can do with your phoenix. The amount of resources required to defend 2 mineral lines from phoenix is a huge hit that early and it will really fuck with their timings for anything else. You can play completely greedy behind the phoenix and just chrono probes and get a quick forge and everything. You have full control of the game in this situation.\n\nTransition to mid game\n\nOnce you have your expansion then the rest is up to you really. The few things you 100% will need shortly after the nexus goes down are a forge, robo bay or twilight council, natural gasses. The build leaves you in control with the phoenix and gives you full scouting potential so it\u0027s very easy to react to what he\u0027s doing. Once you identify that they\u0027re going macro you need to put a forge down ASAP so you don\u0027t fall behind on upgrades. Shortly after that should be your tech of choice (whether it be colossi or twilight for immortal/archon). I personally prefer colossi since you already have the robo and it\u0027s a much quicker and safer transition. Twilight takes a little long and also diversifies your tech a little too much. You\u0027ll be spreading yourself too thin and if you realize that they\u0027re going to do some 2 base timing to kill you shortly after your nexus is up then you\u0027re going to have a hard time defending since you won\u0027t really have anything to defend with. From there you just play a standard macro PvP really.","Name":"sOs Phoenix into Robo","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438335802353,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

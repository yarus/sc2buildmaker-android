If he goes corruptor heavy then stop producing Liberators and start building Vikings and maybe some Thors. A widow mines also could be helpfull.\n\nAdd more factories and starports when enough resources. Also don\u0027t forget to research Blue Flame and Mech Weapons upgrades.\n\nLiberators and tanks provide very strong defence so you should be ok against any possible zerg\u0027s pushes.","Name":"17 CC into Helbat-Tank-Liberator","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1448457571149,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

It then transitions into a strong 3 base Ultralisk timing to either cripple the Protoss opponent or outright win the game.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nScout first with your 2 initial Zerglings, use them to take the Xel’Naga Watchtowers or send them outside the front of the Protoss base depending on the map.   Check to see whether your opponent is Gateway expanding or Forge expanding. Be wary of early pressure if your opponent is Gateway expanding.\r\nWith your 7:00 overlord scout, consider adding a Baneling Nest if you are up against a Gateway timing. Make mass Speedlings to defend any 2 base ground plays or ramp up Queen production early to defend any 2 base air plays.\r\nAgainst a 2 base Colossus push, consider adding a Spire for Corruptors if you need more defense. Also, regardless of whether or not you need to make Corruptors for defense, you should start Air upgrades in case of a Mutalisk switch after you have maxed out with your Ultralisk army.\r\nIdeally, your Ultras should be out with +5/+3 around 15:50. Commit to an attack as soon as possible when these upgrades finish.  If you have yet to take a 4th base and Spire or Hydralisk Den by this stage in the game, get them now.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThere is no “transition” per se.  If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent’s army.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\nAgainst Pylon blocks\r\n\r\n- If you want to try and guarantee the Hatchery being placed, send a Drone to your natural around 11/12 supply and hide it there. This might trick Protoss into thinking that you are going Pool first.  Note that this will not work every time, and it also will not stop a Protoss dedicated to Pylon blocking you.\r\n- A 15 Pool/15 Hatch/15 Gas opener (or at worst – if they fail to cancel the Pylon – a 15 Pool/15 Gas/and Hatchery as soon as you can) will be fine in this case. The most important thing is starting your Extractor on time, not the natural Hatchery.\r\n- Be sure to make 4-6 Zerglings to take the pylon down if you need to, and go up to 3 Queens as soon as you can – just like normal.\r\n- Once you place your Extractor, the first 100 gas goes to Metabolic Boost, and place your Evolution Chambers when you get to 175 gas like normal to transition back into the build.\r\n\r\nThe Engagement\r\n\r\n- Bring your Queens to transfuse, and any optional Infestors or Banelings you made to force good engagements.\r\n- Do NOT engage into a Protoss wall. You want to engage in as open an area as you possibly can for your melee army to do maximum damage.\r\n- Do NOT engage without your queens in transfuse range unless you are sure you can take a strong fight. Strong creep spread with all of your Queens helps tremendously.\r\n- Try to avoid Archons with your Zerglings; use the Ultralisks to tank those. Similarly, focus your Zerglings on Stalkers and Immortals; keep your Ultralisks away from those.\r\n- If you use Ultralisks to crush any forcefields, Zerglings can actually deal with Colossi quite easily as they take minimal damage whilst underneath the Colossi.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is very strong against a “standard” Protoss army of Gateway units, Colossi and some Stargate or Templar units. Also, this timing attack has the strong potential to end the game.\r\nHowever, this build is somewhat simple for Protoss to scout and is vulnerable to timing attacks and all-ins when you only have upgraded Speedlings to defend. Also, if your Protoss opponent is positioned in a well defended location, the engage can be quite difficult to perform well.","Name":"Leenock 3 Base Ultra","Race":"Zerg","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428060283527,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

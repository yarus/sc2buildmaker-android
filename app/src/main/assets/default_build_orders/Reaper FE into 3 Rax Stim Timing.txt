With such a fast attack, you can set the pace of the game instead of letting Protoss dictate when you attack.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nThis build has a fragile beginning (you only have 1 Reaper for quite some time), so scouting with this Reaper is absolutely crucial. You CANNOT lose your Reaper. Instead, use it to spot how many Assimilators your opponent has taken, when they get an expansion (or note if they do not expand by around the 5 minute mark), and how many early game units they are defending with. You must keep the Reaper active on the map to spot for any early aggression and also to prevent your opponent’s first Stalker or Zealot/Stalker from getting to your base and doing damage.\r\n\r\nIf your opponent has not expanded by around the 5 minute mark, then prepare to deal with 1 base play. Extra Bunkers and/or an Engineering Bay for defense may be a smart investment. However, if you can hold until Stimpack and Combat Shields finish (@8:50ish – much earlier than most other builds), then you will be in a great position to counter attack your opponent and do crippling damage.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build can only transition into Bio play, for you have committed all your resources and time into getting the Infantry upgrades and a large Bio army.  Before you focus on your attack, be sure to start a Factory for a standard Reactored Medivac follow-up. After the attack, get a 3rd Command Center, 2 more Barracks (for a total of 5), 2 Engineering Bays, and a Ghost academy/2nd Starport to head into a strong, late game army.\r\n\r\nNote that you can switch the order of the 4th and 5th Barracks with a 3rd Command Center. However, with the strength of Medivac boost and the scary late game Protoss army, most Terrans have been getting their infrastructure up early in order to hit their opponents with a lot of aggression during the midgame. If you get a 3rd Command Center first, then you will have a late game army faster, but you sacrifice a lot of potential midgame aggression, simply by not having extra reinforcements.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- The gas timing of this build is quite important; if you keep all of your SCVs in gas, then you will not have the minerals to get your Command Center or extra Barracks at the correct time.\r\n- Early game Stalker + Mothership Core pressure can be game ending if you lose your initial Reaper. Do NOT lose your Reaper.\r\n- If you believe your opponent is playing with an aggressive 1 base build (for instance, if you scout a Stargate/proxy Pylon/lack of Nexus), add up to 2 Bunkers at the front, and start that Marauder production as soon as possible.\r\n- Oracles massacre un-upgraded Marines, so if your opponent has a Stargate, you should consider skipping Marauders for more Marines or even start an emergency Engineering Bay for one turret per mineral line. Note that even if your opponent does early game damage with an Oracle, your 9 minute attack can still end the game if your opponent’s follow-up is not executed precisely.\r\n- Be sure to move out with your army BEFORE Stimpack and Combat Shields finish. You want to be attacking your opponent’s natural expansion as soon as those two upgrades finish.\r\n- If your opponent is out of position, you can kill their entire army or snipe their natural expansion. However, be sure that you focus fire one or the other down – losing too much DPS by having your units attack both the Nexus and the army is the main way to screw up the attack.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is strong because of how many units you can get out for a pre-10 minute attack. Also, this build makes a fast Reaper to scout throughout the early game. Therefore, this build is a much more aggressive variant of the other Reaper expands possible in TvP.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build is quite vulnerable to early Protoss pokes if you lose your Reaper. Another problem with this build is that with such a low Marine count in the early game, fast Oracles can do a lot of damage if your scouting is not perfect.","Name":"Reaper FE into 3 Rax Stim Timing","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428388054973,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

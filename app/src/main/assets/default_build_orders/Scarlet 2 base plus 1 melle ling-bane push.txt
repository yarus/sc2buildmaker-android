She allins with it on this game which makes sense on Neon Violet Square for reasons stated below and the fact that Innovation was taking an aggressive fast 3rd.\n\nPresumably you could follow up with standard play and just plan on denying the 3rd. Your Map control will be solid. In theory should also be solid into early Terran allins. I think the trigger for Scarlet to commit so hard to the attack in this particular game was the fast 3rd from terran and the lack of a wall off. If you don\u0027t get an easy all in opportunity the transition to Ling Bling Hydra/Muta is pretty easy since you have such solid map presence.\n\n","Name":"Scarlet 2 base plus 1 melle ling-bane push","Race":"Zerg","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1608151527174,"VsRace":"Terran"}

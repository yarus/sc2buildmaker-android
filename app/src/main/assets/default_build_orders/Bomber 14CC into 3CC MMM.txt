The factory is not being used and is placed in a lane that needs vision, on Expedition Lost LE it is outside the natural.\n\nBomber never takes the gasses at his 3rd and so does NOT being 3/3 Infantry Upgrades on time. The game ends at 16:00.\n\nThis build is incredibly greedy! However, it can hold off a 23 Drone 12 Roach Rush that hits at 7:30!\n\nThis build also gives you an army that doesn\u0027t use any splash damage. This is micro intensive and difficult. But, it\u0027s super fun and will force you to practice your splits like your life depends on it!\n","Name":"Bomber 14CC into 3CC MMM","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439459676006,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

The build stays defensive with the early units and MSCore so that you don\u0027t die to any sort of proxies/cheese and then uses a 5:45 hallucination to scout exactly what tech they\u0027re going for.\n\nWith this build DTs are a tad tricky though, so I added in my own little idea to stay safe vs them. At 6:00 is when you normally drop a robo to be safe vs DTs in a standard blink/obs build, however the hallucination scout doesn\u0027t normally get into their base until 20-30 seconds after that time has passed. This can lead to straight up losses due to not having a robo up in time. So since you have the money to make the robo at 6:00 still with this build it\u0027s a good idea to make it incase of DTs (especially if your early probe scout sniffed out DT tech) and then once your hallucination scouts their base you can cancel it if you see no evidence of DTs being made and react accordingly. You can also keep it if you want and do an even safer version of the build, however it will hinder your aggressive options and delay your nexus a bit.\n\nIf they go stargate then you can easily drop a 4th gate and go all in with blink. Be sure to leave the MSCore home to defend against oracles and use the hallucination from the sentry a 2nd time to get vision into their main to blink in there and catch them by surprise.\n\nIf they go blink as well then you\u0027ll need to gauge the situation. It\u0027s best to just make some stalkers and keep some form of map presence as you can and then expand behind it while getting a robo. This is where keeping the 6 minute robo is an OK decision because then you can go into immortals faster for a more defensive option incase he decides to all in with blink. There\u0027s also the off chance that they hid the dark shrine and you don\u0027t see it so keeping the robo after seeing a twilight only is still fine.\n\nThe cool thing with this build that CranK told me to do is to proxy a stargate for an oracle if you see them open greedier than you. This makes perfect sense since the only real downside to opening macro blink builds is that it\u0027s hard to pressure them and get ahead if they open for a greedier build than you. The initial blink stalkers will force them into stopping probes and going defensive for fear of a blink all in, however in the mean time an oracle is being made close to their base. They most likely will use overcharge at their natural as well so the main is left completely undefended for the oracle. All this time you were making probes and expanding yourself and all of a sudden you\u0027re on even footing once more. You can also take a greedier 3rd base since the oracle/blink combo will keep them on the defensive even more so than any other normal build.\n\nOnce you get your expansion up you can continue in whatever way you please whether that be with a fast +2 chargelot/immortal/archon all in or with standard colossus play.\n\n5:45Â Send hallucination to scout\n6:00 Robo (in case of DTs.

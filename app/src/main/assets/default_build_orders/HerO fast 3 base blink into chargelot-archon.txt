Very similar to the idea of the blink into storm/colossus build.\n\nNow what makes this build good is that you can sneak this 3rd nexus in while faking pressure and keeping the terran defensive. Going into charge directly after blink is done and warping in some sentries at home, you are able to really control space well with a good blink stalker/sentry count. Even though people usually think gateway units by themselves are terrible against bio, it\u0027s only true when they\u0027re not upgraded. Having blink/charge AND forcefields together (while in a favorable position) really allows you to control the ~10 minute terran push and keep your 3rd alive and allow you to transition into a strong gate explosion with a chargelot/archon follow up push.\n\nThis build is most effective on maps like Frost where it\u0027s quite large so you have room to make these fast 3 bases and you have a ramp to easily forcefield and deny movement. Heavy Rain is also good for this map. Even though it is smaller, blink all ins are more potent on that map so a terran will think you\u0027re going to all in him more on that map, and you also have the destructible rocks in the middle to safely secure a 3rd.\n\nNow with widow mines becoming much more popular, you might run into some trouble with them while doing this build. You\u0027ll have to make some alterations if that comes into play. You\u0027ll obviously need a quicker robo and some cannons around to play vs delayed widow mines. Until you get the observers up, you can section off a few zealots to activate the widow mines early. Once they have charge it is quite easy to do this and they stay alive long enough to get them into the bio army to even deal some friendly fire.\n\nJust like any other blink opening, you can\u0027t quite go for it if you scout a gas first. You\u0027ll need to go robo first instead and play to that kind of opening.","Name":"HerO fast 3 base blink into chargelot-archon","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439382173015,"VsRace":"Terran"}

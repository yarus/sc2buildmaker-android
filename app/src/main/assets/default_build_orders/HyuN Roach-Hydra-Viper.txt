This build maxes out on Roach/Hydra/Viper in order to crush your opponent’s army or deny their 3rd/4th base.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nScout with either Overlords, Zerglings, Overseer, or Changelings when your Hydralisk Den goes down. Send them into either the main base or the 3rd base in order to see if Protoss is going for a tech-heavy composition (Colossus/Void Ray/etc) or a Chargelot-heavy composition. If they are going for a Chargelot heavy composition, instantly throw down a Banelings Nest, start Baneling Speed, and max out with around 16 Banelings in your unit composition.\r\nBesides this, all mid and late game scouting comes from the Roach/Hydra/Viper pokes or attacks that you will perform. React appropriately by either re-maxing with Ultras or Swarm Hosts. You will need a 5th base to fully support any Hive-tech re-maxes.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThere is no “transition” per se. If you can win the game with this push, then be sure to attack in an open position, use Blinding Cloud or Abduct appropriately, and take the game quickly. If you cannot win the game outright, then fall back on your 4/5 base economy and tech switch to whatever best counters your opponent’s army. Note that you should get a lot of static defense in order to stay safe during your super late game tech switches between Mutalisks, Swarm Hosts, and Ultralisks.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- If your first Overlord scouts your opponent going for a Gateway expand, then you should abandon getting the third base, instead getting an Extractor and starting Metabolic Boost before taking your 3rd.\r\n- If your natural gets Pylon blocked, then you can make an early Overlord at 15 supply instead of the Hatchery in order to buy some time against it. If your opponent lets the Pylon finish, then simply making 4-6 Zerglings to take the Pylon down should be enough of a commitment before returning back to the build.\r\n- Being thorough about checking for early proxy Pylons across the map with your early game Zerglings is crucial against early Protoss timings. Being able to spot aggression and stop it before it can even begin is the easiest way to avoid quick losses.\r\n- Be sure you send in an Overlord scout at 7:00. Spotting your opponent’s midgame tech informs your next step with this build(whether it be more Drones, a Hydralisk Den, or Spore Crawlers).\r\n- Vipers will be usable (Consume finishes) 3:30 after your Infestation Pit starts.\r\n- Scouting for a heavy Chargelot composition before you max can be quite important. Throwing down a Banelings Nest and maxing with several Banelings can be the difference between a quick loss and a sure win.\r\n- Once you have re-maxed on Ultras, starting a Spire and tech-switching between Mutalisks and Swarm Hosts/Ultras is a strong way to win in the very late game. Also note that you should get a lot of static defense when performing these late game tech switches.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build opens with a hugely economic opening while still being safe. It then transitions into a Viper-based defense in order to secure your 4th base and quickly max out on Roach/Hydra/Viper.\r\nThis build however requires constant scouting in order to be safe. Also, it is not great against Skytoss unless you scout it early because you might over-produce Roaches (which obviously cannot shoot up) when gearing up for a normal attack.","Name":"HyuN Roach-Hydra-Viper","Race":"Zerg","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428058380458,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

You can use it in many situations and have a good response for pretty much anything they could do. As evidence to that point, Trap used this exact same build 4 times in a row vs sOs at Redbull DC and won every time with it.\n\nSo the idea behind the build is that you do a 5 stalker rush early on to get maximum map control and pressure potential. After scouting basically everything on your side of the map you turn that control into aggression with a follow up 3 gate attack that hits quite early (~6:40) with an uncommon 8 stalkers. It\u0027 packs a much more powerful punch even though it hits slightly later than traditional 3gates due to the fact that it hits with so many stalkers. Most of the times when you go against an early expand build with a 3stalker rush 3gate you\u0027ll need the aid of an oracle to really close the deal since they\u0027ll be able to get immortals out. However since this hits so powerfully you can get a cancel on the nexus or even end the game. A very cool thing Trap did in game 1 vs sOs on King Sejong is that he went up the ramp with the first 3 stalkers to bait an overcharge from sOs in the main after seeing it was a fast expand. This allowed him free reign over the natural so he could easily kill it. It may not always be that easy but the potential is there.\n\nIf they go blink themselves then the hope is that you hit with so many stalkers so early that you can overwhelm them before they can get blink done. However if this isn\u0027t possible you should back off and try to expand earlier so you don\u0027t die when his blink is done. If they go blink/obs then you should be safe to expand since they won\u0027t be able to commit as hard, however if they go 4gate blink you can make a dark shrine instead of blink to kill them. Going for robo after such a late blink like this is risky as you have a huge window to die to a player who just masses only stalkers.\n\nIf they go stargate then you should kind of just win. Again, the initial 8 stalkers packs a powerful punch and if you can\u0027t end them early then the follow up blink will be a good plan B. Whether it be just to defend a 2nd base easier or to do a follow up all in with blink and 4gates.\n\nIf they go DTs you\u0027ll need to be able to sniff the build out. If you get a feeling that they might go DTs early then you can get a robo behind the 3gates instead of the twilight council to be safe. Or if you can poke early enough with your first 3 stalkers to get a second look to see if they\u0027re going DTs then you can cancel the twilight, make a robo and then warp in sentries at home to block the ramp. You might need to bring your 4th and 5th stalker back to hold position on the ramp as well to buy more time.\n\nIf they go for a very fast robo after an expansion you can also proxy a stargate (or just make one in base) after the twilight finishes (don\u0027t research blink) or after canceling the twilight. It\u0027s a similar response to how you deal with fast expands with thesOs build I did last PvP. Trap nearly kills sOs with the initial 3gate, however gets the stargate anyway which ends up finishing the deal. So even though it\u0027s quite late it still does the job well.\n\nNow the other cool thing with this build is that it has a fast expand variant. The build ends up lining up to be very similar to the safe 2 gate expand that I covered. The only difference is the double chronod stalkers and that the sentries come last and there\u0027s only 2 of them. The nexus and robo go down at identical times. So if you want you can easily learn this build and it\u0027ll be perfect in a best of series since you can open with either the aggressive option or defensive option and then switch it around the 2nd game to trick your opponent since it looks identical to them. If you want some more info on how to follow up the expansion then just check out the 2 gate safe expand write up since it\u0027s basically the same build.","Name":"Trap 5 Stalker rush 3 gate","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438346031368,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

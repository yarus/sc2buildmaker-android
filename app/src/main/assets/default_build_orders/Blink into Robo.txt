Going straight for colossus double forge is extremely passive and leaves no real room for you to do much until you get your 3rd base saturated. However opening blink allows you that small amount of map control/versatility that we loved oh so much a few patches ago that was unfortunately ripped from our repertoire.\n\nThe other cool thing about this build is that unless they open gas first, you can do this build basically any game. Even 1 rax reaper into factory gets shut down by this since the 2nd observer comes out in time to deal with any widow mine drops that will come from that build. You can even do some follow up blink pressure with a lot of added stalkers to punish them while they\u0027re building their infrastructure up and their unit count is low.\n\nEven the 3 rax stim builds that I made a thread on earlier this week can be stopped with this build. I found out really that once you see that build coming into form, then it\u0027s all about not being greedy with your tech and trying to get a colossus out ASAP or something like that. You just need to make as many units as possible out of your gateways. It won\u0027t hold it as well as the purely defensive robo/3gate style however you definitely can still make the hold so long as you get your gates at the time in this write up and not later like in some variants.\n\nThis build puts us back in control again which is what we have wanted for so long after blink/HT openers have been pushed out of style. Of course the only down side to this build is that the upgrades are later, however you can easily compensate for that with double forge and mass amounts of chronoboost being used into it. Since the build is so solid you shouldn\u0027t be losing too many probes to early harassment (early blink helps with that so much) so the only thing that you\u0027ll need to use your chronoboost on is the upgrades.\n\nAdding a warp prism or two while you\u0027re getting your 3rd set up also meshes with this build very well. Many protosses (PartinG especially) almost always go for a warp prism to do a 4 zealot drop after they do some light harassment with the stalkers. It\u0027s just an added way to keep the terran back as you get your colossus set up and really keep the terran on their side of the map for as long as possible. If you don\u0027t have the APM/multitasking to incorporate the earlier warp prism don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s not necessary.","Name":"Blink into Robo","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439311532739,"VsRace":"Terran"}

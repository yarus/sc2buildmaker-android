It is better not to harras with them at all than lose them. If you confident in your micro, you may clean some creep and try to burn some lings with your hellions but make sure not to commit. Dont forget to repair your hellions before push.\n\nSince current zerg ZvT meta is ling-bane into hydra, this push can deny zerg\u0027s 3rd while he has not enough hydras to hold. \n\nIf he has enough to hold, you may try to go for multi-drops with hellions harras while you building your tank count.\n\nThis is not all-in at all since you secure your 3rd and can proceed to bio-tank-liberator lategame.","Name":"ReaperCC into MMMH Stim-Shield-Wpn1 Push","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1515236280348,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

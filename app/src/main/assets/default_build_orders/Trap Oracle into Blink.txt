You need 3 in each to afford everything early on so just make sure to remember that. Otherwise there isn\u0027t too much to say about the execution.\n\nReactions to certain builds\n\nEarly gateway attacks\n\nUnlike the phoenix opener, this one deals with gateway timings much easier. The oracle can do more than the phoenix in terms of back stabbing. It really puts the other player on a timer with their attack if you can get good damage done with the oracle. And with 2 extra gates coming in instead of a robo and 1 gate you will be able to defend much easier. In combination with the oracle doing damage you\u0027ll only really need to stop 1 or 2 waves of units and you\u0027ll be good. Overcharge will help delay and buy time as well.\n\nStargate openers\n\nThis requires some alteration on your part. You can\u0027t really go for the original build if you scout them going for stargate. You\u0027ll have to either cancel and go for faster blink or go into phoenix like the other build. Your oracle won\u0027t be able to do much at all if they go stargate. I prefer going phoenix instead of canceling because if they go oracle then you will shut that down 100% and if they don\u0027t then you can do a 3gate phoenix all in and just poop all over them because they don\u0027t expect you to all in with phoenix. So I\u0027d suggest reading the sOs phoenix opener as well to help with this area of this build.\n\nDTs\n\nIf you sniff out a potential DT opener (no gateway units + no chronoboost + all pylons in base or just seeing the twilight council very early) then you just keep the oracle home and wait for them. If after a while they never come then send it across and just play defensive and macro up and use blink to pressure.\n\nRobo Expand\n\nIn this scenario you\u0027ll be able to use the oracle for full map control and harassment similar to the phoenix opener. The addition to this build is that you\u0027ll have blink to do some light pressure at the front as well. The nexus will be a bit later but you should be able to even the worker count with the oracle and blink. Just be sure not to go overboard with stalkers (just 4-6 is fine) otherwise you\u0027ll end up behind and you probably won\u0027t be able to break him.\n\nAnother thing you can do if you see that it\u0027s a robo expand early on, is to just do a 3gate oracle all in skipping twilight. This is a blind counter to robo expands but you\u0027ll need to see it early enough and choose your reaction immediately.\n\nBlink\n\nThis is the builds biggest weakness. If they go for a straight 3/4gate blink all in then you\u0027re basically dead. Not every PvP build is perfect with a reaction to everything. If this happens then there\u0027s very little you can do since their blink will be much faster and they will have invested more into stalkers earlier than you. The best you can do is hope your oracle stays alive and to kill enough probes after they move out so that you can slowly edge ahead while you wait for your own blink to finish.\n\nTransition to mid game\n\nAgain this is very similar to the sOs phoenix opener. Just get your nexus and a robo/forge to macro up into a normal PvP mid game. Use the oracle and blink to provide light pressure wherever you can fit it.\n\nSomething you can do if you see them being greedy is to do a 2 base blink all in. The linked VOD below has Trap doing it vs Has. Since Has got a very late robo, Trap was able to abuse that with a huge late stalker flood and eventually overwhelm Has.","Name":"Trap Oracle into Blink","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438328816022,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

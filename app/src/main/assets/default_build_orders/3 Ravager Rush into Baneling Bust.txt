The ravagers do a lot of damage at the front of the Terrans base and force them to bring scvs/repair/lose units and fall behind in their build. Behind this you are getting all the drones you need, and can follow up with whatever style you want! \n\nThe best maps are maps with low rush distance and where the main wall only defends their main and not their natural. While your aggression is going on you want to deny mining from their natural, which you can\u0027t do on dusk towers or orbital shipyard. Also, 4 player maps can be dependent on the overlord pathing, if your overlord doesn\u0027t reach their base in time to see their ramp then it can be tricky.\n\n\n\n","Name":"3 Ravager Rush into Baneling Bust","Race":"Zerg","SC2VersionID":"4.11.3","VisitedDate":1470913591046,"VsRace":"Terran"}

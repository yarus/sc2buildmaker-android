They can snipe adepts or use EMP to remove shields from protoss units and energy from sentries. Based on that fact we should be safe against any 1-2 base aggression. If done right build would allow you to have stim ready for majority of protoss pushes. You also have opportunity to do strong 2 base timing with 2 liberators, 2 ghosts, stim-shield, +1 and a bunch of bio units. Another approach is to get 2 medivacs, 3rd CC and go into standard macro game but with ghosts already available for you.","Name":"RaxGas CC into 2 Rax Stim Ghost","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"3.8.0","VisitedDate":1470912695886,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

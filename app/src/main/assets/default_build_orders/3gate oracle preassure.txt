Start banking at the 18 chrono.\n\nFrom here it\u0027s all about reacting to what your opponent is doing. A lot of times you can just kill them with this 3gate oracle pressure, however if you can\u0027t then make a proper read and decide what the best follow up is. If they go robo expand and you can\u0027t kill them, then expanding and going void rays with continued oracle harass is a good option. If they go DT\u0027s, you can either continue chronoing oracles and try to kill them, or play defensive and stay back and get a robo and expand. If versus blink, then your oracle will be able to do a lot of damage since it comes in usually as they are also trying to be aggressive, so you can then fall back and make a robo for immortals as well as void rays to hold you over. This can get tricky sometimes.\n\nIf you want you can try to scout with the MSCore to see what tech they go for, however if you aren\u0027t good at decision making with MSCore scouts I wouldn\u0027t try it as it might end up in more losses than wins.","Name":"3gate oracle preassure","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438348176747,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

If your opponent sends a Reaper at your base, then be defensive with your initial Zealot/Stalker, and use only your Mothership Core to scout around.  If your opponent does NOT send a Reaper at your base, then poke out with your initial Zealot/Stalker and later Mothership Core to poke at your opponent’s front and glean some information about their build.\r\n\r\nWhile your early game is completely safe, therefore making Probe scouting irrelevant, the early midgame is not, and thus scouting is crucial. If you know that your opponent is going for a Widow Mine drop, then get out Observers and several more Stalkers and place them defensively in each mineral line. Be prepared to use the Mothership Core’s Photon Overcharge on whichever Nexus your opponent chooses to drop. Delay Colossus tech in order to favor more units to deal with the harass. This same reaction works against all early drop-based or Banshee play. Against any early frontal assaults, simply Planetary Nexus your natural expansion and warp-in several more units.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build is quite macro-oriented, so playing for the long-game is crucial.  Against standard Bio play, Bio/Mine play, or Bio/Hellbat play, take your third base after your 3rd Colossus and transition into Chargelots, Archons, and Storm. Add more Gateways as your minerals permit. Also, Blink is a good upgrade to prioritize against heavy drop play on maps with a large distance between your main and third bases.\r\n\r\nAgainst Mech play, take your third base and begin heavy Immortal production.  Make Immortals, Archons, and High Templar while on 3 bases, and focus on hitting a +3/+3 timing attack before your opponent is maxed.  Add more Robotics Facilities as your gas permits.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build stays safe against early shenanigans as you macro up and tech straight for Colossus and +1/+1. It also gives you the infrastructure necessary to defend early drops or harassment common in this matchup.  With your upgrade lead and tech advantage, you can safely transition into the lategame by safely taking another base and going for Storm.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Chronoboost your initial Nexus to get out as many probes as early as possible to kick start your economy.\r\n- Use your initial units defensively if you spot a Reaper, or aggressively to scout your opponent’s base if no Reaper appears at your door by the time your Stalker has popped.\r\n- Send your first Observer directly to your opponent’s base in order to see if he’s opening with fast Widow Mines/harassing units, or teching up to a normal Bio timing. Only warp-in units before you get your first Colossus out if you scout your opponent playing aggressively. Delay your Colossus tech and production if you spot your opponent going for a quick drop or early attack play. Instead, focus on making Gateway units and Observers and placing them defensively to maintain your economic advantage. However, if your opponent is NOT attacking early, always prioritize economy and teching up over making Gateway units\r\n- Never underestimate the power of making your Nexus a Planetary Nexus.  At the very least, it is a way to scare off a drop from doing economic damage if your army is out of position.\r\n- Against early drops, target firing the Medivac with your Stalkers and Planetary Nexus can mean the difference between letting your opponent escape and crushing a poorly planned drop.\r\n- Don’t forget to use your Mothership Core’s Time Warp spell against any 2 base Bio timings in order to keep your Colossus safe.","Name":"Rain 1 gate FE to Colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972561707,"VsRace":"Terran"}

You do a normal gate FE and then get 2 gates and a sentry to keep safe vs anything they could possibly throw at you early and then get the stargate with the next 150 gas and make an oracle out of it for any initial drone damage as well as scouting. It is EXTREMELY important you DO NOT lose the oracle. It is more of a scouting unit than it is a harassing unit in this build. You aren\u0027t getting a robo for observers and you aren\u0027t getting a high sentry count for hallucinations so the oracle is your only means of map control. If you wanna try being risky with the oracle to snag a few drone kills here or there that you think you might not get away with, then decide against it and keep the oracle alive instead.\n\nAfter the oracle you go into non stop void ray production.\n\nMid game transition/Reations\n\nFrom the 3rd base you get 2 more stargates and +1 Air to round out your mass void rays. There are a couple things the zerg might do that would require you to do a different response than non stop void ray until like the 20th minute.\n\nHydra/Ling Pushes\n\nSo this is what I think is the most difficult to stop with this exact build. Since it focuses so much on void rays and so little on gateway units it seems it would be a bit awkward to hold hydra/ling. This is why the oracle is so important because you need to identify this is happening as soon as possible. You\u0027ll need more zealots and 1 or 2 more sentries. Keep making void rays as much as you can. You might need to only do 1 extra stargate instead of 2 to be able to keep your gateway production up. You can also get extra cannons by your 3rd to help defend. What you want to be doing is segmenting his army up in tiny tiny bite size chunks. Keep as much of his hydra army away from you as possible. Just stall and delay as much as possible until you get a decent void ray/gateway count up and just splitting off chunks of his army. It\u0027s a very fragile and patient game that you must play. From there it\u0027s best to go into twilight council and storm/charge earlier if he continues to mass hydra. If he goes swarm host after then you can keep going SkyToss.\n\nBurrowed Roaches\n\nThis is a style some zergs like to use vs fast 3rds off of a stargate. Since your units are so slow and you don\u0027t have as many of them (compared to +2/blink openers) he just masses roaches and burrows them all over your 3 bases and widdles you down. If you notice he\u0027s doing this then you\u0027re going to need extra cannons in each base to cover important areas. You should also bring your oracle home for revelationsince you won\u0027t have an observer. Basically if you see it early enough you should be fine since you can spam cannons and void rays.\n\nRoach/Hydra/Viper\n\nThis also elicits the faster twilight response. If you notice him rushing to hive after a passive roach hydra opener (or any roach hydra opener really) then you NEED HT\u0027s to feedback the vipers. If they do the really fast version of this then you won\u0027t be at your critical mass of void rays yet and he\u0027ll be able to pull them all out of position over top his army. So you just need to transition into charge/HT faster.\n\nMutas\n\nSimple enough. Scout that he\u0027s going spire and make phoenix instead of void rays.\n\nLate Game\n\nSo if he\u0027s just being passive and letting you do whatever you want (aka making only void rays) be it with either swarm hosts or whatever, then you want to be going around the map with void ray hit squads to try and snipe hatcheries. This is what Protoss used to do back in 2013 when void ray/HT was popular. You go out with your voids and MSCore and try to snipe hatches since they DPS them down so quickly, and then recall back.\n\nIf he\u0027s being passive you eventually want to still go into twilight for DT harass and storm. If you want to go ahead and mass carriers then by all means go ahead and mass carriers. If you wanna be a little safer and more traditional, then go for faster storm. Just defend, defend, defend and react to any tech switches from zerg and then take the golden fight when you find it. It\u0027s a relatively simple game plan, but still fragile if caught out before you get the carriers out. Since you have such a high void ray count though (like 20) then it should deter the zerg from trying to actually engage you.","Name":"Terminator Oracle into SkyToss","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438682970307,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

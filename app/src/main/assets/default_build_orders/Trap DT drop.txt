Not many people are expecting DT drops anymore so they can do quite the damage to unprepared Terrans and lead you into a nice mid game with the colossus to defend and the warp prism to continue harassment for basically the whole game if you can keep it alive.\n\nThe opening is like a normal twilight opening with a 28 TC off of a normal 1 gate FE. There\u0027s a proxy pylon after the 2nd stalker to hide the dark shrine to make it easier to surprise the terran. If they get a reaper in or scan you can easily throw a chrono down on the TC to fake going blink. If you want you can warp the first DT in from your proxy pylon and send it across the map and then when your warp prism gets to their base the 2nd warp in will be ready, or you can just do it with the warp prism half way to his base and load it up and once more when you get there, either way it doesn\u0027t really matter.\n\nThe build also gets an early sentry after 2 stalkers to help defend vs any 3 rax aggression. In the sample video Trap uses a forcefield on the ramp to keep him from going up into the main and keeping him down by the overcharge. Even though he loses like 12 probes, the 3 rax commitment is so strong that your DT\u0027s will be able to do equal if not more damage than the 3 rax. This is especially true since they won\u0027t have turrets up since they have to delay their ebay for a long time when doing a 3rax. Their SCV count will also be low from the start. So even if you can\u0027t defend perfectly at your natural, make sure you can do a lot of damage with the DTs. Keep them alive as long as possible by picking them up out of scans with the warp prism etc.\n\nTrap does a pretty greedy follow up after the DT opening. He goes into 2 forges instead of 2 gateways and gets a later robo bay as well. This is because he knows his DTs will be keeping Reality back so he can tech up like that, however if you want to play it safer then the follow up I provided will be much better for you. It gets the 2 extra gates at 8 minutes as well as the robo bay. A single forge comes slightly earlier. If you notice the terran went for earlier ebays then you can go for double forge. Play as greedy as you would like to.\n\nFrom there you just make more gates around 9-10 minutes in anticipation for their mid game medivac pressure and take a 3rd base whenever you feel safe with blink and colossus while denying/harassing their 3rd with the warp prism.","Name":"Trap DT drop","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439301998425,"VsRace":"Terran"}

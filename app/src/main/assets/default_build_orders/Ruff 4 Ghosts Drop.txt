Follow up with Nukes, Battlecruisers, or Liberators.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dtU_qybMllX0\n\nAnalysis\n\nThis build is best on maps where you can wall off your natural easily with your initial buildings. Wall off your natural or you will not be able to defend it with this small number of units.\n\nYou can get off a snipe on the first queen at your opponents natural if they go hatch first (depending on map rush distance). If they go gas/pool first you will lose your Ghost to Speedlings, which does not end the build but is a setback. The safest play is to lift your Barracks and snipe the overlord scouting your natural.\n\nYour goal with the opener is to snipe as many queens as possible without losing ghosts or your medivac. Reducing the number of Queens severely weakens the Zergs anti-air defense making Battlecruisers a very strong follow up. If you see your opponent quickly teching into anti-BC (or if you like to troll) you can also followup with mass Nuke.\n\nWith the four ghosts you will either spot queens spreading creep outside the natural, or you can drop harass at the main ramp. The goal here is to safely get off snipes on queens and retreat to kite as many lings as possible without losing ghosts so you can safely land your 3rd CC.\n\nThis is only the build order for the drop which is fairly simple. It is basically continually producing ghosts while teching into a medivac.\n\nWhen you go for the drop, build two refineries at your natural and either tech into starport + fusion core for BCs or add cloak + ghost academies for nukes. The replay/cast provided shows the nuke version. The supply count listed here will differ from the replay due to RuFF losing his first ghost.\n\nYou can follow up with mech or bio but your stim and upgrades are very delayed with bio.\n\n","Name":"Ruff 4 Ghosts Drop","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1608626798283,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

Continue chronoing probes when you know you’re safe.\n\nFrom the point it leaves off it’s up to you to decide what you want to do. You can go into twilight tech for immortal/archon to do a +2 timing or go into passive colossus play.\n\nLike the name suggests, the opening is extremely safe and versatile. Early aggression is completely thwarted with this build as you get an early Sentry and MSCore to defend proxy oracles or gateway pressure. The 4 extra units that you get out of the gateways before expanding really deny any sort of early 3 or 4gate attacks while the MSCore defends vs phoenix and oracle play. The only thing you’ll need to be careful with is DT openers since the robo is a little bit late compared to other builds. You should be able to get an idea that DTs will be coming though after seeing little to no unit production with your probe scout and maybe even the twilight council if you’re diligent enough. In that case you can get the robo before your nexus if you want to be safe, however with 2 forcefields and stalkers to block the ramp you should be able to stall until your observer is out.\n\nMake sure you remember to use your hallucination scout at 6 minutes to know exactly what you’re up against. If you see them playing passively you can skip a 3rd gate and get a much faster forge to be ahead on them in upgrades. You also don’t need to warp in anything when WG is done if you see them playing passively, it would just be a waste of resources that don’t do anything. You only want to be making units when you need to be or have the money to in PvP. If they out greed you in the opener you need to find ways to out greed them in the follow up. Going for double immortal warp prism harass is another great way to abuse greedy play.","Name":"2 gate safe expand","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438615961896,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

Based on the game between Bomber and ByuN, if he didnâ€™t make the second Cyclone, he would have 200 gas when the Starport finishes. Thus, this means that there is flexibility in whether you make one or two Cyclone. If you make one, you can swap the Starport onto the Tech Lab and make a Cloaked Banshee or Raven. If you make two, you only have gas for either a Viking or Medivac.\n\nIn this build, I choose to get Cloaked Banshee.","Name":"Cyclone Expand into Cloaked Banshee","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"3.0.0","VisitedDate":1449845433930,"VsRace":"Terran"}

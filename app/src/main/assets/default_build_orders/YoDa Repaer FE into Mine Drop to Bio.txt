Use them for scouting by poking at your opponent’s front in order to determine what your opponent can or cannot be doing as well as potentially killing a Marine or SCV.  Against Reaper play, keep your Reapers more defensively positioned.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build can transition into Marine/Tank or Mech very easily. However you cannot transition into Bio/Hellbat because you have not invested any time into getting the early game Bio upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen transitioning into Marine/Tank, start your tank production soon, using the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe as well as apply pressure. As your Medivac is moving out, swap your Barracks onto the Factory’s Reactor and start double Marine production, add on a Tech lab onto your Factory to start Siege Tank production, and build two more Barracks and a third Refinery as soon as you can afford it to complete your 2 base infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhen transitioning into Mech, again you must rely on the Widow Mines and Reapers to stay safe and apply pressure, but this time back at home you must be playing greedily. You can dump your money into a 3rd base while your Medivac is moving out. Once you’ve started 3 bases, getting 2 more Factories, all your Refineries, and a decent Siege Tank count is your obvious next move. YoDa likes to also make a Tech lab on his Starport to get Ravens, but this is a stylistic choice that you don’t have to make.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is great because it gives you a good economy and gives you lots of map control with the early game Reapers/Widow Mines. The harass you can apply is incredibly effective if you split up your Widow Mines effectively throughout your opponent’s base.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is somewhat vulnerable to Banshee play, so be sure to position your Widow Mines defensively against Banshees. Also, with poor Medivac control, you can very easily lose your Medivac and all the Widow Mines if you fly directly into a Viking or Marine pack. Be sure to prioritize keeping the Medivac alive above all else. Lastly, it’s not as economical as a 1rax FE build, but it still gets a pretty reasonably fast expand, so it’s not too far behind a 1rax FE build in terms of economy at all.","Name":"YoDa Repaer FE into Mine Drop to Bio","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427972378993,"VsRace":"Terran"}

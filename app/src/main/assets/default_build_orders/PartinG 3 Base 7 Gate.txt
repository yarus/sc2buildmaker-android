With a 3 base economy, it then hits a 9 minute 7 gate attack comprised of mainly Stalkers and Sentries.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nThis build opens incredibly greedily, so be sure that your opponent is expanding and droning with an initial Probe scout. Besides any initial Probe(s), however, this build does not give you any tools with which to scout your opponent. The majority of your scouting will come with the actual attack at 9 minutes.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build can either all-in or transition comfortably into a macro game.\r\n\r\nIf you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to constantly warp-in and chronoboost your Gateways, set up several proxy Pylons around your opponent’s third base, and stop all Probe production.\r\n\r\nIf you are choosing to play the macro game, then only use the attack to hopefully deal a bit of damage while you continue producing Probes and teching at home. Getting a Twilight Council, all of your gasses, and going for a +2 Blink Stalker army is a good choice.  Alternatively, you can start a Robotics Facility, all of your gasses, and go straight for Colossi.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.\r\n- Keep your Mothership Core out in front of your natural to help ward off any scouting Zerglings.\r\n- Until you are ready to attack, position your Sentries and Zealot very defensively. Staying against buildings or walls will increase the effectiveness of defensive force fields dramatically.\r\n- Use 2 of your Gateways to wall-in a Photon Cannon while your third base is being set up. A Cannon that cannot be targeted by Zerglings is incredibly effective at stopping runbys.\r\n- Be sure to start moving out before +1 actually finishes in order to hit your opponent as early as possible.\r\n- Constantly warp-in Stalkers with the attack, using your initial 8 Sentries to keep back enemy Roach/Ling armies.\r\n- Don’t forget to mass recall your army back home if you end up getting surrounded.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is an incredibly greedy build that initially powers economy hard and then transitions into a powerful 7 Gate attack. You have both a strong army and a strong economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build does not get much tech before the attack. Therefore, transitioning out of your attack into a more standard unit composition takes more time than more standard PvZ builds.","Name":"PartinG 3 Base 7 Gate","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1427985909394,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

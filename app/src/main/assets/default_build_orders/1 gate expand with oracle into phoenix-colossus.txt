Going straight into phoenix production isn\u0027t viable/effective due to how the phoenix will not be doing anything during the early stages of the game. The oracle fills that hole by allowing for some harassment as well as map control and scouting. You then tech up to colossus while the oracle is doing it\u0027s thing so you can defend any terran aggression coming around the 10-11 minute mark.\n\nDon\u0027t worry if they scout your stargate. While it would be great if it goes completely undetected, that\u0027s not often the case. If it does get scouted then just try to keep the terran back in his base as long as possible by picking off an SCV where ever you can find an opening. If you can delay the factory or starport while it\u0027s building that is the best case so that way you buy yourself more time to get more colossus and phoenix out.\n\nThe phoenix production starts at the perfect time to get 2-3 out for the earliest medivac pushes. There\u0027s no reason to get them earlier as they don\u0027t serve a purpose in defending bio pokes at the natural. They come just in time to do their job of defending drops.\n\nOne thing that is a bit tricky to hold off when doing this style is fast stim pushes that some terrans are doing now. You\u0027ll need to bring the oracle back home and potentially delay the robo bay by getting an immortal and some extra units out of the gateway. It is a slightly greedy opener after the oracle and if they prepare well then there is a timing before the 1st colossus comes out to do some damage.\n\nOnce that window is passed however you are in complete control. Your phoenix will deny any drops and your colossus allow you to take a 3rd base. I personally suggest not staying on pure phoenix/colossus like some pros have been doing and instead just use it as a mid game drop defense method and then transitioning into twilight tech like a normal PvT after 3-4 colossus and a handful of phoenix.\n\nUpgrades are also delayed with this as a result of you denying drops so heavily. You can compensate by going double forge instead of one if you would like, otherwise just make sure your twilight and 2nd forge timings are crisp so you don\u0027t get delayed in upgrades at all. You should get armor --\u003e attack and then when attack is about 60% done you get your twilight and 2nd forge so that way +1 attack finishes when the extra forge and twilight do so you can start +2/+2 right away at the same time.","Name":"1 gate expand with oracle into phoenix-colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439364766695,"VsRace":"Terran"}

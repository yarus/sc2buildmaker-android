We then go up to our 2/1/1 setup with the goal of hitting a 16 Marine attack at the great timing of 5:03. (5:03 because that is when your main Orbital Command will gather another 50 energy).\n\nBehind it, we will obtain our third CC at an early time of 4:30. This is the most economical we can get it while still getting our drop out in time. Afterwards, we go into 3 bases with a 5/1/1 setup plus double Engineering Bay into the midgame. We aim to build Widow Mine only out of the Factory for the powerful 4M setup.\n\nTo supplement our initial pressure, we add a third Medivac with 1 Widow Mine and 6 Marines, with a fast Combat Shield that finishes up at 6:00. This followup is especially good against 2 base Muta openings, which is one of the most attractive features of the build.\n\n","Name":"ByuN 2-1-1 Stim push into Macro","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"5.0.3","VisitedDate":1608315825769,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

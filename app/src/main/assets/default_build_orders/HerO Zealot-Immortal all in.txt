It\u0027s a less all in version of a normal zealot/immortal all in since it actually gets a few sentries and gas at the natural instead of going for the lowest number of probes with hardly any gas at all. It hits a bit later but with a much bigger punch.\n\nThe cool thing about this build as well since it\u0027s less all in, is that if it gets scouted you can easily transition out of it and harass with an immortal drop or a sentry drop in the main and FF the ramp. This is because of the fact that you actually get the natural gasses.\n\nJust a few things you have to remember about this build is that you have to be aware of speedling all ins. This is because your natural wall off is going to be a bit later than most builds, so you want to be sure that nothing is hitting you before you can get it down. If needed you can wall off quicker if you see something coming.\n\nAlso make sure you hide your robo fairly well. If a zerg sees that fast of a robo they\u0027re going to expect something so it\u0027s best to hide it as much as possible. But like I said, even if it gets scouted you have the choice to fall out of the all in and play macro instead. Or you can just attack anyway since it still just works most of the time.","Name":"HerO Zealot-Immortal all in","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438864964896,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

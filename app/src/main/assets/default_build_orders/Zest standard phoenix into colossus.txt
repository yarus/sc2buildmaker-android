Force the Zerg to make hydras and spores to counter the five phoenix you make and then counter this forced investment by teching quickly to colossus. The phoenixes then provide the scouting information that you need to react well to the multitude of strategies that Zerg can throw at you. On top of this advantage they are excellent at harassment (killing drones and queens) and at denying map vision.\n\nHard counters: Greedy Zerg play is the best thing against this build. The phoenix force Zerg into hydras however they do not guarantee the fact that Zerg doesn’t take a 4th base and drone as hard as possible. Still this does not mean that the game is over, with good scouting of Zerg’s eggs you can take your own 3rd earlier than 10:20 and develop your own economy alongside Zerg’s. In addition to this weakness early swarm host play off 2 base can be extremely hard to deal with due to the investment into phoenix. A throughout probe scout at the start of the game to deduce if gas has been taken and Zerg’s third base timing will give you the information you need to go robo first or oracle instead of phoenix.\n\nReactions: Reaction should be made after seeing units pop out of the eggs.\n\nLings: Take a slightly earlier 3rd (9:30), skipping immortals and making several zealots to protect the probe and constructing nexus.\n\nRoach: Start immortals before colossus. Either 2 immortals or 1 before the first colossus depending on how early Zerg starts producing roach. Here it is also important to not skip the observer because roach burrow may be a possibility.\n\nHydra: Skip immortals and continue colossus production.\n\nVipers: Add Templar archives as soon as possible; cut out void rays as soon as the hive is scouted. For this to work well you may need to warp in zealots for the time being instead of stalkers so you can immediately have gas for 3-5 high Templars when the archives finishes. With this Zest invested in charge first vs Leenock to synergize with his gas investment in Templar while warping in only zealots before the viper timing.","Name":"Zest standard phoenix into colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438940263656,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

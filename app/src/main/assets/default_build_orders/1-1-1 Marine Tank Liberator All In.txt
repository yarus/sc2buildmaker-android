But in LOTV overcharge was changed so tanks now outrange cannon. Liberator is good support unit for this push which would make it even harder to fight against marines. You should also take some SCVs with you for tank and liberator repairs.\n\nThis build is very strong on small maps.","Name":"1-1-1 Marine Tank Liberator All In","Race":"Terran","SC2VersionID":"4.11.3","VisitedDate":1449040735793,"VsRace":"Protoss"}

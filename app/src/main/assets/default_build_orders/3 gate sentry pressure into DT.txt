The cool thing is that you don\u0027t even need to pressure with the units. You can, but really all you need to do is show that you have some sentries and zealots coming their way, send a hallucinationÂ to scout and then stay at a watch tower and fake them into over reacting while you take a 3rd and tech to this wonderful thing called the Dark Shrine.\n\nNow these aren\u0027t meant to be the fastest DTs in the world by any means, but they hit at such an awkward time that the zerg really shouldn\u0027t be expecting (especially after seeing a 3gate sentry pressure opening). So they have a chance to do quite a good deal of damage. Also, if they commit to a counter attack with the early units you forced out of them the DTs will do much more damage and you will also have your robo pumping out immortals at home to defend any roach follow ups that could happen.\n\nAfter your cheeky DTs do their job you can saturate your 3rd and go up to +2/blink/immortal for a strong 3 base timing a few minutes after the DTs hit that can outright end the game if they aren\u0027t prepared or took too much damage from the DTs.\n\nThe high sentry count early on also makes it so you can throw out non stop hallucinations to really see what the zerg is up to an what tech they\u0027re choosing. If you see swarm hosts you of course need to throw down a robo bay and 2nd robo instead of doing the immortal +2 follow up otherwise you own\u0027t be ale to bust them. Mutas can also be dealt with via base trade quite well (so long as you identify it quickly enough and can hit while they\u0027re in production and you leave some cannons at your 3rd).\n\nIf they go for a high hydra count and it doesn\u0027t seem like your +2 blink immortal follow up can kill them then you can go into some form of splash damage while taking a 4th and just harassing them a bit to keep him away from your 4th and buy time for said splash damage. I prefer going into HT\u0027s since the tech is slightly faster and mixes well with the unit comp, but if you want to do a double robo colossus follow up thats OK if they didn\u0027t go for a fast hive.","Name":"3 gate sentry pressure into DT","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438784024941,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

While you are using the scouting Phoenix, you transition into Colossus play in order to secure your third base and set up a stable midgame OR all-in your opponent with a Stalker/Colossus/Phoenix army.\r\n\r\nScouting\r\n\r\nAfter any early game shenanigans are ruled out, as you have spotted your opponent s third Hatchery going down, the rest of your scouting will come from your Phoenix.\r\n\r\nUse your Phoenix to first pick off every Overlord on the map that is undefended by creep/Queens. Then use them to poke around your opponent s base   picking up units not protected by Spore Crawlers/Queens. Be sure to focus on what tech structures you see your opponent making. If you spot a swell of Roaches, stay on 2 bases and consider extra Immortals. If you spot a Hydralisk Den, be sure your Robotics Bay is constantly producing Colossus. If you spot a Spire, instantly get a Twilight Council and go for Blink/+2 Ground Weapons while you resume Phoenix production from your Stargate. You might have to cancel your Colossus production.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nThis build can either all-in off of 2 bases or safely secure a third base to comfortably play a macro game.\r\n\r\nIf you are choosing to all-in with this build, be sure to go up to 8 Gateways and 3 Colossus with Extended Thermal Lance before moving out. Constantly reinforce with Stalkers as you use your +1/+1, 3-Colossus, 5-Phoenix, 8 Gateway all-in to crush through a Roach/Hydra based army. Watch out for Viper play, though!\r\n\r\nIf you are choosing to play the macro game, timing your third base is tricky. Dear warps in a lot of Zealots from his 4 Gateways before securing his third if he sees any amount of units on the map with his constant Phoenix scouting. If Dear doesn t see any Roach/Ling force out on the map (as in game 3 of Dear vs Soulkey), then he will take it even before his first Colossus is started. As you take your third base, set up a Cannon defense surrounded by Pylons/Gateways to help with Zergling runbys as you tech up into the late game. Getting a Twilight Council to continue +2 Ground Weapons and Blink is a solid way to both deal with tech switches and set you up for a 3 base attack. Be sure to spend your excess minerals on proxy Pylons and Zealot runbys to keep your opponent s base count in check.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n\r\n- Spend all of your early game chronoboost on your two Nexus to maximize Probe production.\r\n- The exact FFE build order you use is up to your personal preference. Dear has performed this build after a Forge First FFE, Nexus First FFE, and a failed attempted Cannon Rush.\r\n- If possible, hide the Stargate somewhere in your base that is less likely to be scouted by an Overlord.\r\n- Chronoboost your Stargate to get out those Phoenix as quickly as possible to deny any Overlord scouting of your follow-up Robotics transition.\r\nA main strength of this build is its versatility, but you can only be versatile if you have the necessary scouting information. Scouting your opponent s tech path and army production with your Phoenix is crucial.\r\n- If you spot your opponent playing very greedy, you can choose to warp-in all of your Zealots from your 4 Gateways aggressively and hit a +1 Zealot/Phoenix timing while continuing the build at home.\r\n- Chronoboost your Robotics Facility to get out your Colossus as quickly as possible and set up a solid midgame army.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build is an incredibly versatile build that can be used as a macro opener or a 2 base all-in. It gets out early Phoenix for scouting and map control while transitioning into a solid ground based Colossus midgame.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build requires a lot of APM and focus in order to execute. Reacting to your opponent s tech choices and unit composition while macroing at home is not easy.","Name":"Dear Phoenix into Colossus","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438684137757,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

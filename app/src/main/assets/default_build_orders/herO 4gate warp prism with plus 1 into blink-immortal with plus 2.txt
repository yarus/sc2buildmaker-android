While the pressure is going on you will get a Twilight Council and a 3rd for +2 and blink so that you can do a follow up immortal/sentry/stalker push that has the possibility to end it. Even if you can\u0027t end it you have a 3rd to macro with and +2 tech as well. You can easily transition into templar or late colossus if you want depending on what they\u0027re going.\n\nYou\u0027re going to want to do constant chronoboost on probes except for the warp prism.Â You might need one on +1 attack if you can\u0027t get it started early enough. The sentry production should be constant and you can get 4 out right when warp gate and your 3 extra gates is done so be sure to line that up. herO goes at 3 sentries instead of 4 but you can definitely wait for 4 and do 2 warp ins before you attack instead of one. herO even gets spotted before the 1st warp in and waits for 2 and gets a lot of damage done.\n\nDon\u0027t be afraid if you need to cancel your 3rd if they counter attack. You can delay it as long as you do decent damage at their 3rd. The 3rd isn\u0027t really necessary that early but since you can get it down then, you might as well try to.","Name":"herO 4gate warp prism with plus 1 into blink-immortal with plus 2","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1438702343543,"VsRace":"Zerg"}

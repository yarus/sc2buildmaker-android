It\u0027s a normal 1 gate FE blink opening. You get your twilight council on 29 supply after 1 stalker and then a 2nd stalker afterwords. Lately people have only been going 2 stalkers in the early game instead of 3 so that way they can fit in 2 gateways at 36 supply while opening blink as well. This would make it so that the 2 extra gates (3 in total) would be finished right when WG was done. Before that, literally everyone opened 3 stalkers but with a later 2nd and 3rd gate that didn\u0027t quite finish when WG was done. This build is a best of both worlds and what I assume might become the standard now for defensive blink openings. herO goes for a 2nd gate at 34 supply instead of 2nd and 3nd at 36, which allows him to still get the 3rd stalker from the gateway. Then once WG is finished researching, he warps in 2 more to get that nice number of 5 which is what you would get normally anyway. So you basically end up at the same thing (just with 1 less gateway since you aren\u0027t planning on being super aggressive with the blink) but now with 3 stalkers early to help defend instead of 2. It\u0027s a small little variation, but a rather useful one to give you that nice defense of 3 stalkers before WG is finished while still ending up with a nicely timed tech and gateway count.\n\nOne other important thing to note: herO only chronoboosts his blink research ONCE. Yeah...only once. That\u0027s very rare. He instead puts all chrono into his probes to get full saturation and simply waits for blink to finish. So basically you can completely focus on chronoing probes if you want. If you forget to chrono blink once it doesn\u0027t even matter cause apparently not even herO does that sometimes with this build.\n\nExtra tech and mid game transition\n\nWith every defensive blink opener we need a robo right? Luckily for us, herO gets the timing for the robo down absolutely perfectly. Literally the earliest we could need an observer after a standard 1 rax reaper FE is around 8 minutes. When does the observer come out of this 6:35 timed robo? 8 minutes. This will allow you to defend any 1 rax reaper FE into factory builds with relative ease (as long as your control and map awareness are on point) and give you a strong edge going into the mid game.\n\nAll the while this is going on, a very sneaky and early timed dark shrine has been placed at 7:30. This is earlier than the Trap build I used in the past (which went down at about 8 minutes), which adds to the greediness of this build. This earlier dark shrine allows you to time up a nicely executed dual pronged attack with 7 stalkers and 3 DTs in a warp prism. This is showcased brilliantly vs Flash from Proleague. As you drop the DTs in, you also do some poking with the blink stalkers at the bunker or any SCVs near the front. Or you can do it visa versa. Distract and fake blink all in by poking at front bunker --\u003e drop DTs into main. He continues doing this for quite a long time which allows him to do the next step in the build.\n\nWhile this DT/blink harass is going on, herO makes some decisions that REALLY enforces the greedy aspect of the build. Not only does he get a robo bay AND two forges during the 8th minute, he also EXPANDS at 9:20. He is heavily relying on his blink/DT harass to scare of the Terran to allow him to get away with this. He even starts +1/+1 BEFORE a colossus. At 11 minutes into the game his unit count is literally 61 probes, 1 DT, 1 colossus, 7 stalkers, 1 warp prism and a MSCore. If the Terran makes a strong defense of the blink/DT harass then a counter attack is extremely lethal and potentially game ending. If you don\u0027t feel safe being this greedy, then by all means delay the 3rd base and get a few gates before hand while you get a colossus and a sentry or two. Most terrans will want to be attacking you more often than not so it\u0027s better to play a little safer on ladder anyway. This build obviously is being done this greedy due to the fact that herO is playing against Flash.\n\nLate game\n\nThe build transitions quite easily into late game. After your 3rd is saturated you get a nice gateway explosion of up to about 12-14 or so. You start +2/+2 right when 1/1 is done and then a Templar Archives shortly after for storm. herO also gets warp prism speed for some random reason. I guess he just feels he has the money to get it so he does. I personally would prefer observer speed since it\u0027s a little more helpful (since warp prisms are fairly fast already now) and if you\u0027re going to spend your money on something like that at that point in the game, it might as well be for observer speed since it\u0027s so vital later on. However, from there it\u0027s a fairly standard PvT game. Not much changes because of the opener in terms of late game play.","Name":"HerO greedy blink into DT drop","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1439219342446,"VsRace":"Terran"}

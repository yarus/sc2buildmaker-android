As long as you can confirm your opponent is getting a third Hatchery (and sometimes even if they are not getting one), you should be able to go through with this build.\r\n\r\nWith your attack, you will be able to scout what units he is using to defend. If you are fighting mass Speedling, then constantly warp-in Zealots and Sentries.  If you are fighting Roaches, then constantly warp-in Stalkers. Your opponent should not be able to get out either Hydras or Mutalisks in time to defend this attack.\r\n\r\nTransitions\r\n\r\nIf it appears that your opponent has way over-committed to defending your attack with units or Spine Crawlers, you can always retreat and go for the macro game. Either force field your opponent back and walk home or mass recall your army to your natural Nexus. A common follow-up to this build is starting a Robotics Facility and going for Colossi to deal with your opponent s Roaches. Alternatively, you can go for a Stargate and make Phoenix in order to prepare for your opponent s Mutalisks. Be sure to use Hallucinations often to check-up on what midgame tech your opponent is going for. Take a third base when you feel safe.\r\n\r\nPros and Cons\r\n\r\nThis build opens with a Gateway expand, so your 5gate attack will hit very soon (before 7 minutes). This build usually hits your opponent before they have any midgame tech.\r\n\r\nHowever, this build relies on you deflecting your opponent s scouting information in order for it to be maximally effective. If your opponent sees your Gateway count before you move out, then it is unlikely you will be able to out-produce a mass Roach defense.","Name":"MacSed 5gate","Race":"Protoss","SC2VersionID":"2.2.0","VisitedDate":1428083037145,"VsRace":"Zerg"}
